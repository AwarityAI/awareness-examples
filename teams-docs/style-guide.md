### Microsoft Writing Style Guide

#### General Writing Style
1. **Tone and Voice**: Use a warm, relaxed, friendly, and conversational tone. Avoid robotic language.
2. **Clarity and Simplicity**: Write short, simple sentences. Avoid jargon, idioms, and complex structures.
3. **Active Voice**: Use active voice and indicative mood. Use imperative mood for instructions.
4. **Customer Focus**: Focus on what the customer needs to do, not on Microsoft or the UI.
5. **Inclusivity**: Use gender-neutral language and avoid terms associated with violence or exclusion.
6. **Consistency**: Use one term consistently for one concept. Avoid synonyms for the same feature.
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure content is accessible with alt text, captions, and transcripts for multimedia.

#### Grammar and Punctuation
1. **Capitalization**: Use sentence-style capitalization for headings, UI text, and most content. Capitalize proper nouns and product names.
2. **Oxford Comma**: Use a comma before the conjunction in a list of three or more items.
3. **Periods and Spaces**: Use one space after periods, question marks, and colons.
4. **Quotation Marks**: Place closing quotation marks outside commas and periods.
5. **Hyphens and Dashes**: Use hyphens for compound adjectives and en dashes for ranges. Avoid hyphenating "non-" and "pre-" words unless necessary.
6. **Ellipses**: Use to indicate pauses or omitted text.
7. **Exclamation Points**: Use sparingly and only when necessary.
8. **Semicolons**: Use to separate independent clauses or items in a complex series.

#### Formatting and Structure
1. **Headings**: Use consistent headings to provide structure. Avoid end punctuation in headings.
2. **Lists**: Use bulleted lists for unordered items and numbered lists for sequential steps. Capitalize the first word of each item and avoid punctuation unless items are complete sentences.
3. **Tables**: Use tables for complex information with clear purposes and left-aligned text.
4. **White Space**: Use white space effectively to improve readability.

#### Numbers and Dates
1. **Numbers**: Spell out numbers zero through nine; use numerals for 10 and above. Use commas in numbers with four or more digits.
2. **Dates**: Use the format "month day, year" (e.g., July 31, 2016). Avoid ordinal numbers.
3. **Time**: Use AM and PM in uppercase, preceded by a space.

#### Technical Terms and UI References
1. **UI Elements**: Use bold for UI elements like buttons and tabs. Avoid input-specific terms like "click" or "swipe"; use input-neutral verbs.
2. **Commands and Options**: Use "select" instead of "press" or "hit." Use "turn on" and "turn off" instead of "power on" and "power off."
3. **File and Folder Names**: Use lowercase for file attributes and URLs. Use sentence-style capitalization for folder and directory names.
4. **Terminology**: Avoid creating new terms. Use industry-standard terms and define technical terms in context.

#### Accessibility and Localization
1. **Localization**: Avoid culture-specific references and idioms. Use simple, clear language for non-native speakers.
2. **Alt Text**: Provide brief, accurate alt text for images and multimedia.
3. **Translation**: Write content that is easy to localize and translate.

#### Style-Specific Rules
1. **Contractions**: Use common contractions to maintain a conversational tone.
2. **Abbreviations**: Spell out terms on the first mention, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
3. **Measurements**: Use numerals for measurements and include a space between the numeral and unit.
4. **Spelling**: Use US spelling and avoid non-English words or phrases unless necessary.

#### Bot and Conversational UI
1. **Bot Tone**: Be friendly, concise, and task-focused. Admit limitations and build trust.
2. **Bot Responses**: Keep responses short and specific. Recognize common commands like "help" and "stop."
3. **Feedback**: Allow users to provide feedback directly through the bot.

#### Miscellaneous
1. **Avoid Redundancy**: Prune excess words and avoid unnecessary repetition.
2. **Avoid "Simply"**: Do not use "simply" to imply ease of use.
3. **Avoid "We"**: Focus on the customer and avoid using "we" in general writing.
4. **Avoid "Etc."**: Be specific or use phrases like "such as" or "like" with examples.
