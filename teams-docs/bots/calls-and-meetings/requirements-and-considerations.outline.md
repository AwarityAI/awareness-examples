# Requirements and Considerations for Calls and Meetings Bots

## Introduction

- Importance of understanding requirements before development
- Overview of key considerations for calls and meetings bots

## Media Bot Hosting Requirements

- **Infrastructure Needs**
  - Dedicated hosting environment for media processing
  - Hardware specifications (CPU, memory) for optimal performance
  - Network bandwidth and latency considerations
- **Supported Hosting Options**
  - Hosting on Azure services (Virtual Machines, Kubernetes)
  - On-premises hosting considerations
  - Compliance with Microsoft hosting policies

## Scalability and Performance

- **Designing for Scalability**
  - Handling multiple concurrent calls and meetings
  - Load balancing strategies
  - Stateless vs. stateful architectures
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Reducing latency in media processing
  - Efficient resource utilization
  - Monitoring and tuning system performance

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - Securing signaling and media endpoints
  - Implementing token validation and renewal mechanisms
- **Data Protection**
  - Handling sensitive information securely
  - Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)
- **Encryption and Compliance**
  - Using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  - Ensuring compliance with industry standards

## Network and Connectivity

- **Firewall and Port Configuration**
  - Required ports for signaling and media traffic
  - Configuring firewalls and NAT traversal settings
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**
  - Ensuring consistent media quality
  - Prioritizing network traffic for real-time communication

## Licensing and Permissions

- **Required Licenses**
  - Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 licensing requirements
  - Additional licenses for telephony features
- **Permissions Setup**
  - Configuring application permissions in Azure Active Directory
  - Granting admin consent for necessary permissions

## Limitations and Constraints

- **Concurrency Limits**
  - Maximum number of concurrent calls and participants
  - Resource limitations per bot instance
- **Feature Limitations**
  - Unsupported scenarios and functionalities
  - Known issues and their workarounds

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

- **Industry-Specific Regulations**
  - Healthcare (HIPAA), finance (FINRA), and other regulations
- **Recording and Privacy Laws**
  - Obtaining user consent for recording
  - Regional legal considerations and compliance

## Best Practices

- **Planning and Assessment**
  - Conducting a thorough needs assessment
  - Aligning bot capabilities with organizational goals
- **Testing and Validation**
  - Stress-testing under realistic conditions
  - Validating performance and scalability
- **Ongoing Maintenance**
  - Monitoring bot performance in production
  - Implementing updates and security patches promptly
