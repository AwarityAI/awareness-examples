# Workflow bot in Teams

A workflow bot allows users to interact with an Adaptive Card. Adaptive Card action handler enables the Adaptive card to converse in Teams app. You can create a workflow bot in multiple scenarios for your users to enhance the user experience, such as incident management, ticketing, approval workflow, and project management cards. You can create and assign a work item with workflow bot and sync the content to Azure DevOps or Jira system.

A workflow bot can be installed into a team, group chat, or as personal app, depending on different scopes. The default command logic returns an Adaptive Card. You can customize this logic with your business requirement. For the customization, you need to call your existing APIs.

**Advantages**:

* Automates business processes and repetitive workflows without leaving the context of conversations.
* Supports users with sequential workflow through various cards progressively, without sending additional cards.
* Provides up-to-date user-specific views.
* Simplifies programming model with TeamsFx SDK.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can select the capability that you want to install, when adding the app. For more information, see [configure default install options](../../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-publish-overview.md#configure-default-install-options).

You can create a workflow bot to respond to the Adaptive Card triggered by users. Adaptive Card action handler powered by TeamsFx SDK can execute the Adaptive Card universal action `Action.Execute` triggered by users. In response to this respective card action in the conversation, the Adaptive Card action handler sends another Adaptive Card.

## Card action handler

To simplify the creation of a workflow bot, the TeamsFx SDK provides an Adaptive Card action handler `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler`. You can focus only on the development of workflow bot to respond to the card action without learning the Bot Framework.

The following diagram illustrates how to respond to an Adaptive Card action with TeamsFx SDK:

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/sbs-workflow-bot-action-card.png" alt-text="Diagram shows workflow bot card action handler." lightbox="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/sbs-workflow-bot-action-card.png":::

1. **Action card**: The card where you define your action that users can invoke, for example the `DoStuff`.
1. **Card action handler**: Triggered when users invoke the corresponding card action, its `triggerVerb` is same as the `verb` property in Adaptive Card action. It can send a response card to respond to the action.
1. **Response card**: The card that responds to the action when user invokes it from the action card.

To handle card actions with TeamsFx SDK, each card action handler must implement the `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler` interface:

```typescript

TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler 
{
    /**
     * The verb defined in adaptive card action that can trigger this handler.
     */
    triggerVerb: string;

    /**
     * Specify the behavior for how the card response will be sent in Teams conversation.
     * The default value is `AdaptiveCardResponse.ReplaceForInteractor`, which means the card
     * response will replace the current one only for the interactor.
     */
    adaptiveCardResponse?: AdaptiveCardResponse;
    
    /**
     * The handler function that will be invoked when the action is fired.
     * @param context The turn context.
     * @param actionData The contextual data that associated with the action.
     */
    handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse>;
}
```

## Customize initialization

You can initialize the workflow bot with your own adapter or customize after initialization. The default initialization is located in `bot/src/internal/initialize.js(ts)`.

You can update the initialization logic to:

1. Set `options.adapter` to use your own `BotFrameworkAdapter`.
1. Set `options.command.commands` to include multiple command handlers.
1. Set `options.cardAction.actions` to include multiple action handlers.
1. Set `options.{feature}.enabled` to enable multiple `ConversationBot` functionality.

For more information on initialization customization, see [additional initialization customization](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Respond-to-chat-commands-in-Teams#customize-initialization)

## Add card actions

To add card actions with JavaScript and TypeScript, follow these steps:

<br>

<details>

<summary><b>1. Add an action to your Adaptive Card</b></summary>

You can add a new action (button) to an Adaptive Card by defining it in the JSON file, such as add a new `DoSomething` action to the `src/adaptiveCards/helloworldCommandResponse.json` file.

The following code is an example of the action type `Action.Execute`:

```helloworldCommandResponse.json
{ 
  "type": "AdaptiveCard", 
  "body": [
    ...
    {
      "type": "ActionSet",
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "Action.Execute",
          "title": "DoSomething",
          "verb": "doSomething" 
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

When the action is invoked in Teams, verb property is required, so that the TeamsFx conversation SDK can invoke the corresponding action handler.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure to provide a global unique string for the verb property, when you're using a general string that might cause a collision with other bot. This can avoid unexpected behavior.

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>2. Respond with new Adaptive Card</b></summary>

You can return a new Adaptive Card for each action invoked to display the response to end user. You need to create a new file, `bot/src/adaptiveCards/doSomethingResponse.json` as a response for the `doSomething` action with the following content:

```
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "size": "Medium",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "text": "A sample response to DoSomething."
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.4"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can design your card layout according to your business need. See, [adaptive Card designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/).

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>3. Add action handler</b></summary>

You can handle a new action invoked by Adaptive Card with TeamsFx SDK's class `TeamsFxAdaptiveCardActionHandler`. You need to customize the action in this step, such as calling an API, processing data, or any other action as per your business need.

### [JavaScript](#tab/JS)

You can create a new file `bot/src/cardActions/doSomethingActionHandler.js`:

```doSomethingActionHandler.js
    const { AdaptiveCards } = require("@microsoft/adaptivecards-tools");
    const { AdaptiveCardResponse, InvokeResponseFactory } = require("@microsoft/teamsfx");
    const responseCard = require("../adaptiveCards/doSomethingResponse.json");

    class DoSomethingActionHandler { 
    triggerVerb = "doStuff";

        async handleActionInvoked(context, message) { 
            const responseCardJson = AdaptiveCards.declare(responseCard).render(actionData);
            return InvokeResponseFactory.adaptiveCard(responseCardJson);
        }
    }

     module.exports = {

       DoSomethingActionHandler,
    }
```

### [TypeScript](#tab/TS)

You can create a new file `bot/src/cardActions/doSomethingActionHandler.ts`:

```doSomethingActionHandler.ts
    const { AdaptiveCards } = require("@microsoft/adaptivecards-tools");
    const { AdaptiveCardResponse, InvokeResponseFactory } = require("@microsoft/teamsfx");
    const responseCard = require("../adaptiveCards/doSomethingResponse.json");

    export class DoSomethingActionHandler {
        triggerVerb = "doSomething";

        async handleActionInvoked(context, message) { 
            const responseCardJson = AdaptiveCards.declare(responseCard).render(actionData);
            return InvokeResponseFactory.adaptiveCard(responseCardJson);
        } 
    }
```

---

> [!NOTE]
>
> * `triggerVerb` is the verb property of your action.
> * `actionData` is the data associated with the action, which may include dynamic user input, or some contextual data provided in the data property of your action.
> * If an Adaptive Card is returned, the existing card is replaced with it by default.

<br>

<summary><b>4. Register the action handler</b></summary>

You need to configure each new card action in the `conversationBot` that enables the conversational flow of the workflow bot template. You can navigate to `bot/src/internal/initialize.js(ts)` file and update the `actions` array of the `cardAction` property.

The following steps help you to register the action handler:

1. You can open file `bot/src/internal/initialize.js(ts)`.
1. You need to update your `conversationBot` initialization, to enable `cardAction` feature. Add the handler to `actions` array using the following code:

   ```initialize.js(ts)
         const conversationBot = new ConversationBot({ 
        ... 
        cardAction: { 
          enabled: true, 
          actions: [ 
            new DoStuffActionHandler(),
            new DoSomethingActionHandler() 
          ], 
        } 
      });
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > To learn more about extending the Workflow bot template, see [respond to card actions in Teams](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Respond-to-card-actions-in-Teams)

<br>

</details>

## Customize the action response

You can use the `adaptiveCardResponse` property in handler to customize how the bot sends the Adaptive Card to users. Following are the three options to customize:

* The response card is replaced by the current card where the button is defined for the interactor that triggers the action. The users in the conversation can still view the original action card `AdaptiveCardResponse.ReplaceForInteractor` by default.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/replace-for-interactor.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to customize how the bot sends an adaptive card." lightbox="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/replace-for-interactor.png":::

* The response card is replaced by the action card for all users in the chat, and they can view the response card `AdaptiveCardResponse.ReplaceForAll`.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/replace-for-all1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the replaced the action card for all users in the chat with the acknowledge button." lightbox="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/replace-for-all1.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/replace-for-all2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the replaced the action card for all users in the chat without the acknowledge button." lightbox="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/replace-for-all2.png":::

* The response card is sent as a separate message in the conversation that can't replace the action card. All users in the chat can view the response card `AdaptiveCardResponse.NewForAll`.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/new-for-all.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the response card sent for all as users in the chat as a separate message." lightbox="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/new-for-all.png":::

### Respond with text message

You can also respond with text messages instead of using Adaptive Card for card action response, using `InvokeResponseFactory.textMessage`:

```
async handleActionInvoked(context: TurnContext, actionData: any): Promise<InvokeResponse> {
    return InvokeResponseFactory.textMessage("This is a sample card action response!");
}
```

You can see the following response message in Teams:

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/sample-card-action-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a sample card response.":::

### Respond with error messages

When you want to return an error response message to the client, you can apply `InvokeResponseFactory.errorResponse` to build your invoke response. The following image shows error message in Adaptive Card:

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/error-message-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an error response message.":::

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the invoke response format, see [response format](/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/universal-action-model?branch=pr-en-us-7193).

### Customize Adaptive Card content

You can edit the file `src/adaptiveCards/helloworldCommand.json` to customize Adaptive Card to your preference. The file `src/cardModels.ts` defines a data structure used to fill data for the Adaptive Card.

The binding between the model and the Adaptive Card is done by matching name such as, `CardData.title` maps to `${title}` in Adaptive Card. You can add, edit, or remove properties, and their bindings to customize the Adaptive Card to your needs.

You can also add new cards, if needed for your application. To build different types of Adaptive Cards with a list or a table of dynamic content using `ColumnSet` and `FactSet`, see [TeamsFx-Samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/ga/adaptive-card-notification).
