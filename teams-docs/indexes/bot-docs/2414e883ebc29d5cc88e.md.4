| 413 | **Code**: `MessageSizeTooBig` <br/> **Message**: Message size too large. | The size of the incoming request was too large. For more information, see [format your bot messages](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/format-your-bot-messages). | No | Reduce the payload size. |
| 429 | **Code**: `Throttled` <br/> **Message**: Too many requests. Also returns when to retry after. | Too many requests sent by the bot. For more information, see [rate limit](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/rate-limit). | Yes | Retry using `Retry-After` header to determine backoff time. |
| 500 | **Code**: `ServiceError` <br/> **Message**: *various | Internal server error. | No | Report the issue in [developer community](~/feedback.md#developer-community-help). |
| 502 | **Code**: `ServiceError` <br/> **Message**: *various | Service dependency issue. | Yes | Retry with exponential backoff. If the issue persists, report the issue in [developer community](~/feedback.md#developer-community-help). |
| 503 | | Service is unavailable. | Yes | Retry with exponential backoff. If the issue persists, report the issue in [developer community](~/feedback.md#developer-community-help). |

### Status codes retry guidance

The general retry guidance for each status code is listed in the following table, bot must avoid retrying status codes that aren't specified:

|Status code | Retry strategy |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 403 | Retry by calling the GCC API `https://smba.infra.gcc.teams.microsoft.com` for `InvalidBotApiHost`.|
| 412 | Retry using exponential backoff. |
| 429 | Retry using `Retry-After` header to determine the wait time in seconds and in between requests, if available. Otherwise, retry using exponential backoff with thread ID, if possible. |
| 502 | Retry using exponential backoff. |
| 503 | Retry using exponential backoff. |
| 504 | Retry using exponential backoff. |
