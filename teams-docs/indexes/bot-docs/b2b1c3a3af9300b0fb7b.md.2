### Content

#### Do: Establish a clear persona

Is your bot's tone friendly and light, “just the facts”, or super quirky? How should it respond in different scenarios? Planning and documenting your bot's persona makes it easier to write responses that seem natural and cohesive.

#### Do: Clearly convey what your bot can do

Welcome messages and tours help people understand what they can do with your bot.

#### Don't: Obscure your bot's features

First impressions matter. People will likely be confused or suspicious when presented with a nondescript sign-in message.

#### Do: Recognize non-questions

Your bot should be able to respond to messages like "Hi", "Help", and "Thanks" while also accounting for common misspellings and colloquialisms.

#### Don't: Miss out on opportunities to delight

Some people expect conversations to flow naturally like they would with a real person. Try to avoid clumsy responses to simple messages.

### Troubleshooting

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-help-do.png" alt-text="Example showing bots should help users understand how to use bots.":::

#### Do: Provide help

If your bot can’t satisfy a request, provide ways for a user to educate themselves about interacting with your bot.

   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-help-dont.png" alt-text="Example showing your bot shouldn't strand users.":::

#### Don't: Leave users stranded

People will quickly abandon your bot if they can’t troubleshoot issues.

### Complex interactions

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-interactions-do.png" alt-text="Example showing you can use modal dialogs or tabs with your bot for complex interactions.":::

#### Do: Use dialogs or tabs

If your bot provides an answer that requires a few more steps, you can link to a modal dialog or tab to complete the task or flow.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-interactions-dont.png" alt-text="Example showing how your bot should avoid multi-turn interactions.":::

#### Don't: Make multi-turn interactions tedious

An extensive conversation to complete a single task is slow and overly complex. It also requires the developer to account for state changes (such as the conversation timing out or you sending a “Cancel” message).

### Privacy

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-privacy-do.png" alt-text="Example showing how bots should only show private information in a personal context.":::

#### Do: Only show sensitive info in a personal context

If your bot is in a group chat or channel, we recommend directing users to a private location (such as a modal dialog, tab, or browser) to view sensitive information.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-privacy-dont.png" alt-text="Example showing how bots shouldn't reveal sensitive information to a group or people.":::

#### Don't: Some content isn’t meant to be seen by everyone

Your bot shouldn’t reveal sensitive information to a group of people.
