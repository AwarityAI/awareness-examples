### implementing prompts in Teams AI Library JavaScript

Prompts in the Teams AI Library are implemented using JavaScript by creating a `PromptManager` instance and defining prompt templates within a specific folder structure. The process involves several technical requirements and steps:

1. **Technical Requirements**:
   - The Teams AI Library is built on top of the Bot Framework SDK, so you need to import the necessary functionalities from the Bot Framework SDK.
   - The library is available for JavaScript/TypeScript applications and can be accessed via the `teams-ai` package on NPM.
   - You need to have Node.js, Visual Studio Code, and the Teams Toolkit installed to set up and run your project.

2. **Steps to Implement Prompts**:
   - **Create a PromptManager**: You start by creating a `PromptManager` instance in your JavaScript code. This involves specifying the folder where your prompts are stored. For example:
     ```javascript
     const prompts = new PromptManager({
       promptsFolder: path.join(__dirname, '../src/prompts')
     });
     ```
   - **Define Prompt Templates**: Prompts are defined in a folder, typically named "prompts". Each prompt consists of two files: `skprompt.txt`, which contains the text of the prompt, and `config.json`, which specifies the prompt completion configuration.
   - **Configure Prompts**: The `config.json` file includes settings such as model type, maximum input tokens, maximum tokens for output, temperature, and other parameters that control the behavior of the model.
   - **Register Functions and Actions**: You can enhance prompts by adding functions and registering actions. Functions can be included in the prompt template using syntax like `{{ $variableName }}`. Actions are registered using methods like `app.ai.action` to handle specific user intents.

3. **Code Examples and Documentation**:
   - Code examples for implementing prompts are available in the Teams AI Library's GitHub repository. For instance, you can find JavaScript samples in the `js` folder.
   - The documentation provides a quick start guide and detailed instructions on setting up and using the Teams AI Library, including how to implement conversational AI and manage prompts.

Overall, the Teams AI Library provides a structured approach to implementing prompts, allowing developers to create intelligent, user-friendly applications for Microsoft Teams.
