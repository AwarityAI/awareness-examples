**Calling OpenAI APIs Using the Teams AI Library:**

To integrate OpenAI APIs within your Teams application, the Teams AI Library provides the `OpenAIModel` class. Developers can create an AI model instance by supplying the necessary API keys and configurations. For example, in JavaScript, you can instantiate the `OpenAIModel` with your OpenAI API key and specify the desired model type:

```javascript
const { OpenAIModel } = require('teams-ai');

const openAIModel = new OpenAIModel({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY',
  completionParams: {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
  }
});
```

This allows your bot to make requests to OpenAI's services and leverage GPT-powered language models for generating responses and handling conversational experiences.

---

**Performing Content Moderation Using Built-in Classes:**

The Teams AI Library includes built-in classes for content moderation, such as `OpenAIModerator` and `AzureContentSafetyModerator`. These classes can be configured to filter inappropriate content for both user inputs and bot outputs.

To implement content moderation, you can define a moderator during your app initialization. For example, using `AzureContentSafetyModerator`:

```javascript
const { AzureContentSafetyModerator } = require('teams-ai');

const moderator = new AzureContentSafetyModerator({
  endpoint: 'https://YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_API_KEY',
  blockedCategories: ['Hate', 'Violence'],
  blockedThreshold: 'High'
});

// Add the moderator to your app configuration
const app = new Application({
  aiOptions: { moderator }
});
```

You can also register actions to handle flagged content:

```javascript
app.ai.action('FlaggedInputAction', async (context, state) => {
  await context.sendActivity('Your message was flagged by our content moderation system.');
});

app.ai.action('FlaggedOutputAction', async (context, state) => {
  await context.sendActivity('The bot is unable to provide a response to that request.');
});
```

---

**Code Snippets and Examples Demonstrating Integration:**

Yes, there are code snippets and examples demonstrating OpenAI integration and content moderation within the Teams AI Library. These can be found in the documentation and code samples provided by Microsoft. Examples include:

- **OpenAI Integration**: Demonstrated through the instantiation of the `OpenAIModel` class with API keys and model parameters, as shown above.

- **Content Moderation**: Examples show how to set up moderators like `AzureContentSafetyModerator` and handle flagged inputs and outputs using action handlers.

---

**Managing AI-Powered Intent Recognition Without a Dialog System:**

The Teams AI Library manages AI-powered intent recognition by utilizing a prompt-based approach and a planning engine, rather than relying on a traditional dialog system. Here's how it works:

1. **Prompt-Based Interactions**: Prompts are defined and managed to create conversational experiences. These prompts guide the AI model to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses.

2. **Planning Engine**: The library includes a predictive engine that detects user intents based on the conversation context and maps them to relevant actions defined by the developer.

3. **Action Handlers**: Developers register action handlers for each action the bot can perform. When the AI model recognizes an intent, it generates a "plan" that includes the required actions to fulfill the user's request.

4. **Natural Language Understanding**: By leveraging GPT-powered language models, the bot can interpret user messages and react accordingly, enabling it to handle complex workflows naturally.

5. **Conversation History and Context**: The library maintains conversation history, allowing the AI model to consider past interactions when interpreting intents and generating responses.

This approach allows for natural, flowing conversations without the rigid structures of a dialog system, making interactions more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Integrating OpenAI with Microsoft Teams bots TypeScript

    },
  });

  const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
  ```

**d. Testing Authentication:**

- Before integrating into the bot, test the API call independently to ensure authentication is successful.

### 3. Sample Code Snippets for Implementing OpenAI's GPT Models in a Teams Bot

**a. Handling Incoming Messages and Sending Requests to OpenAI:**

```javascript
// Inside your bot's message handler
this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
  try {
    // Extract user message
    let userMessage = context.activity.text.trim();

    // Prepare the prompt for OpenAI
    const messages = [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: userMessage },
    ];

    // Call OpenAI API
    const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL,
      messages: messages,
      max_tokens: 150,
      temperature: 0.7,
    });

    // Get the assistant's reply
    const assistantReply = completion.data.choices[0].message.content;

    // Send the reply back to the user
    await context.sendActivity(assistantReply);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error communicating with OpenAI API:', error);
    await context.sendActivity('Sorry, I encountered an error processing your request.');
  }

  await next();
});
```

**b. Using Adaptive Cards for Rich Responses:**

```javascript
const adaptiveCard = {
  type: 'AdaptiveCard',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'TextBlock',
      text: assistantReply,
      wrap: true,
    },
  ],
  actions: [],
  version: '1.3',
};

await context.sendActivity({ attachments: [CardFactory.adaptiveCard(adaptiveCard)] });
```

**c. Maintaining Conversation Context:**

```javascript
// Store conversation history in state
const conversationData = await this.conversationState.get(context, { messages: [] });

// Add the latest user message
conversationData.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userMessage });

// Limit the number of messages to maintain context without exceeding token limits
if (conversationData.messages.length > 10) {
  conversationData.messages.shift(); // Remove the oldest message
}

// Call OpenAI API with conversation history
const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL,
  messages: conversationData.messages,
  max_tokens: 150,
  temperature: 0.7,
});

// Get assistant's reply and add to conversation history
const assistantReply = completion.data.choices[0].message.content;
conversationData.messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: assistantReply });

// Save state
await this.conversationState.saveChanges(context);

// Send reply to user
await context.sendActivity(assistantReply);
```

### 4. Handling OpenAI API Responses and Integrating Them into the Bot's Conversation Flow

**a. Processing API Responses:**

- **Extract the Response:**
  - Access the `content` property from the API response to get the assistant's reply.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const assistantReply = completion.data.choices[0].message.content;
    ```

- **Handle Formatting:**
  - Clean up the response if necessary (e.g., removing extra whitespace or unsupported markdown).
  - Convert code snippets or tables into formats supported by Teams or Adaptive Cards.

**b. Sending Responses to the User:**

- **Simple Text Reply:**
  - Use `context.sendActivity()` to send a plain text message.
    ```javascript
    await context.sendActivity(assistantReply);
    ```

- **Rich Text or Adaptive Cards:**
  - For responses that include rich text, images, or interactive elements, format the response using Adaptive Cards.

**c. Error Handling and User Feedback:**

- **Catch API Errors:**
  - Implement try-catch blocks around API calls to handle network issues or API errors.
  - Provide user-friendly error messages.

- **Fallback Responses:**
  - If the API fails, consider providing a default response or asking the user to rephrase their question.

**d. Managing Conversation Context:**

- **State Management:**
  - Use conversation state to store previous messages.
  - This allows the bot to provide context-aware responses.

- **Token Limit Considerations:**
  - Be mindful of the token limits in API requests.
  - Trim the conversation history if necessary to stay within limits.

**e. Security Considerations:**

- **Protect Sensitive Data:**
  - Ensure API keys and endpoints are not exposed in code repositories.
  - Use secure storage solutions for secrets.

- **Compliance and Privacy:**
  - Ensure that the data sent to OpenAI complies with your organization's data policies.
  - Avoid sending sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) to the API.

### Additional Tips

- **Use the Teams AI Library:**
  - Consider using the Teams AI Library, which provides interfaces and components optimized for integrating AI services into Teams bots.

- **Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate:**
  - For a low-code approach, use Power Virtual Agents in conjunction with Power Automate to connect to OpenAI services.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively integrate OpenAI's GPT models into a Microsoft Teams bot, providing users with a powerful and interactive conversational experience.

## Microsoft Bot Framework and TeamsAdapter configuration TypeScript

To build a Microsoft Teams bot using the Bot Framework, you'll need to configure the `TeamsAdapter`, set up authentication, implement error handling middleware, and manage state without necessarily using the dialog system. Here's how you can accomplish each of these tasks:

---

**1. Configuring the `TeamsAdapter` for a Teams Bot**

The `TeamsAdapter` acts as a bridge between your bot application and the Teams platform. To configure it, you need to create an instance of the adapter and provide it with the necessary credentials:

**Steps:**

- **Import the required modules:**

  ```javascript
  const { TeamsAdapter, TeamsBot } = require('@microsoft/teamsfx');
  const { Configuration, CloudAdapter } = require('botbuilder');
  ```

- **Set up the adapter with credentials:**

  ```javascript
  // Read environment variables or configuration settings
  const config = new Configuration();
  const appId = process.env.MicrosoftAppId || '<Your Microsoft App ID>';
  const appPassword = process.env.MicrosoftAppPassword || '<Your Microsoft App Password>';

  // Create the TeamsAdapter instance
  const adapter = new TeamsAdapter({
    appId: appId,
    appPassword: appPassword,
  });
  ```

- **Initialize the bot with the adapter:**

  ```javascript
  const bot = new TeamsBot(adapter);
  ```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that your `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword` are securely stored, such as in environment variables.
- These credentials are obtained when you register your bot in the Azure Bot Service.

---

**2. Setting Up Authentication in a Teams Bot Using the Bot Framework**

Authentication allows your bot to securely interact with users and access protected resources on their behalf. Setting up authentication involves registering your application, configuring OAuth settings, and updating your bot's code to handle authentication flows.

**Necessary Steps:**

- **Register Your Application in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory):**

  - Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and register a new application.
  - Record the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.
  - Create a **Client Secret** and store it securely.

- **Register Your Bot with Azure Bot Service:**

  - Go to the [Azure Bot Service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.BotService%2FBotServices) and create a new bot registration.
  - Enable the **Microsoft Teams** channel in your bot's channel settings.
  - Set the **Messaging endpoint** to your bot's endpoint (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/messages`).

- **Configure OAuth Connection Settings:**

  - In your bot's Azure resource, navigate to **OAuth Connection Settings**.
  - Add a new connection with the following:
    - **Name:** This will be used as `ConnectionName` in your bot code.
    - **Service Provider:** Select the identity provider (e.g., Azure AD).
    - **Client ID and Secret:** Use the App ID and Client Secret from your registered application.
    - **Scopes:** Specify the scopes required for your bot to function.

- **Update Environment Variables in Your Bot Project:**

  ```env
  MicrosoftAppId=<Your Microsoft App ID>
  MicrosoftAppPassword=<Your Microsoft App Password>
  MicrosoftAppTenantId=<Your Tenant ID>
  ConnectionName=<Your OAuth Connection Name>
  ```

- **Implement Authentication Code in Your Bot:**

  - **Using Middleware for Single Sign-On (SSO):**

    ```javascript
    const { TeamsSSOTokenExchangeMiddleware } = require('@microsoft/teamsfx');

// Add SSO token exchange middleware to the adapter
adapter.use(new TeamsSSOTokenExchangeMiddleware(adapter));
    ```

  - **Handling Token Requests and Responses:**

    ```javascript
    adapter.onTurn(async (context, next) => {
      if (context.activity.type === 'message') {
        // Check for authentication
        const tokenResponse = await context.adapter.getUserToken(context, ConnectionName);
        if (!tokenResponse) {
          // Prompt user to log in
          await context.sendActivity('Please sign in to continue.');
        } else {
          // User is authenticated
          await context.sendActivity(`You are logged in as ${tokenResponse.name}.`);
        }
      }
      await next();
    });
    ```

**Notes:**

- Replace `ConnectionName` with the name of your OAuth connection.
- The authentication flow may vary depending on whether you're using SSO or traditional OAuth prompts.

---

**3. Implementing Error Handling Middleware in a Teams Bot**

Error handling middleware allows your bot to gracefully handle exceptions and provide feedback to users without crashing.

**Steps:**

- **Define an Error Handler:**

  ```javascript
  adapter.onTurnError = async (context, error) => {
    // Log the error for debugging
    console.error(`\n [onTurnError]: ${error}`);

    // Send a friendly message to the user
    await context.sendActivity('Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later.');

    // Optionally, clear state to prevent the bot from getting stuck
    await conversationState.delete(context);
  };
  ```

- **Implement Custom Middleware (Optional):**

  If you want to create more sophisticated error handling, you can implement custom middleware:

  ```javascript
  class ErrorHandlerMiddleware {
    async onTurn(context, next) {
      try {
        await next();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`\n [Middleware Error]: ${error}`);
        await context.sendActivity('An unexpected error occurred.');
      }
    }
  }

  // Add middleware to the adapter
  adapter.use(new ErrorHandlerMiddleware());
  ```

**Notes:**

- The `onTurnError` handler catches exceptions in the bot's turn processing and provides a centralized place to handle them.
- Always log errors for analysis but avoid disclosing sensitive information to users.

---

**4. State Management Without Using the Dialog System**

While the Bot Framework provides a dialog system for managing conversational state, you can manage state manually using built-in state management classes.

**Steps:**

- **Set Up State Management Objects:**

  ```javascript
  const { MemoryStorage, UserState, ConversationState } = require('botbuilder');

// Use memory storage (or replace with Azure Blob Storage, CosmosDB, etc.)
const memoryStorage = new MemoryStorage();

// Create user and conversation state objects
const userState = new UserState(memoryStorage);
const conversationState = new ConversationState(memoryStorage);

// Add state middleware to the adapter
adapter.use(userState);
adapter.use(conversationState);
  ```

- **Create State Property Accessors:**

  ```javascript
  // Define state property accessors
  const userProfileAccessor = userState.createProperty('UserProfile');
  const conversationDataAccessor = conversationState.createProperty('ConversationData');
  ```

- **Manage State in Your Bot Logic:**

  ```javascript
  // Example bot turn handler
  adapter.onTurn(async (context, next) => {
    // Get state values
    const userProfile = await userProfileAccessor.get(context, { name: '' });
    const conversationData = await conversationDataAccessor.get(context, { lastInteraction: '' });

    if (context.activity.type === 'message') {
      // Update conversation data
      conversationData.lastInteraction = new Date().toISOString();

      if (!userProfile.name) {
        // Prompt for user name
        userProfile.name = context.activity.text;
        await context.sendActivity(`Nice to meet you, ${userProfile.name}!`);
      } else {
        await context.sendActivity(`Hello again, ${userProfile.name}!`);
      }

      // Save state changes
      await userState.saveChanges(context);
      await conversationState.saveChanges(context);
    }

    await next();
  });
  ```

**Notes:**

- Use state property accessors to read and write state data.
- State can be persisted to various storage providers, not just in-memory storage.
- Managing state this way provides flexibility without the overhead of dialogs.

---

**Summary:**

- **Configuring the `TeamsAdapter`** involves creating an instance with your bot's App ID and App Password.
- **Setting up authentication** requires registering your app and bot, configuring OAuth settings, and updating your code to handle authentication flows.
- **Implementing error handling middleware** can be done by defining an `onTurnError` handler on the adapter or creating custom middleware classes.
- **Managing state without dialogs** is achievable by using the `UserState` and `ConversationState` classes and their property accessors.

By following these steps, you can build a Teams bot that is authenticated, robust, and maintains state effectively. This approach allows for customization and control over your bot's behavior without relying solely on the dialog system provided by the Bot Framework.

## Adaptive Cards in Teams bots TypeScript

**Creating and Sending Adaptive Cards in a Teams Bot:**

To create and send Adaptive Cards in a Microsoft Teams bot, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Adaptive Card JSON:**
   - Create a JSON object that represents the Adaptive Card following the [Adaptive Card schema](https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json).
   - Include elements such as `TextBlock`, `Image`, `Container`, and actions like `Action.Submit` or `Action.OpenUrl`.
   - You can use the [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) to visually design your card and generate the JSON payload.

2. **Attach the Adaptive Card to a Bot Message:**
   - In your bot code, use the Bot Framework SDK to create an attachment from the Adaptive Card JSON.
   - For example, in Node.js:
     ```javascript
     const adaptiveCard = {
       type: 'AdaptiveCard',
       body: [
         // Your card content here
       ],
       actions: [
         // Your card actions here
       ],
       $schema: 'http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json',
       version: '1.5',
     };

     const cardAttachment = { contentType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive', content: adaptiveCard };
     ```
   - In C#, you can use:
     ```csharp
     var adaptiveCardAttachment = new Attachment
     {
         ContentType = "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
         Content = adaptiveCardJson
     };
     ```

3. **Send the Adaptive Card Message:**
   - Use the bot's context to send the message with the card attachment.
   - Example in Node.js:
     ```javascript
     await context.sendActivity({ attachments: [cardAttachment] });
     ```
   - Example in C#:
     ```csharp
     await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(adaptiveCardAttachment), cancellationToken);
     ```

**Best Practices for Designing Adaptive Cards for Task Confirmations and Updates:**

- **Clarity and Simplicity:**
  - Keep the content concise and focused on the task confirmation or update.
  - Use clear headings and bullet points to organize information.

- **Visual Hierarchy:**
  - Utilize containers, columns, and spacing to structure the content logically.
  - Highlight key information using emphasis properties or subtle color differences.

- **Consistent Design:**
  - Align the card's look and feel with your brand and the Teams interface.
  - Maintain consistency in fonts, colors, and action placements.

- **Actionable Elements:**
  - Include appropriate actions like `Action.Submit` for confirmations or `Action.OpenUrl` for additional information.
  - Use descriptive titles for action buttons (e.g., "Confirm", "Cancel", "View Details").

- **Feedback Mechanisms:**
  - Provide feedback to the user after an action is taken, such as displaying a success message or error notification.
  - Use additional Adaptive Cards to communicate the result of their action.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure all users can interact with the card by following accessibility guidelines.
  - Provide alt text for images and test the card with assistive technologies.

- **Dynamic Content:**
  - Design the card to accommodate dynamic data, making it reusable across different scenarios.

**Code Samples for Generating Adaptive Cards Dynamically:**

Yes, you can generate Adaptive Cards dynamically based on bot interactions. Here's how:

- **Using Templating:**
  - Utilize the [Adaptive Cards Templating SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/) to define a card layout with placeholders.
  - At runtime, populate the template with data.
  - Example in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    const ACData = require('adaptivecards-templating');
    const templateJson = require('./cardTemplate.json'); // Your template JSON
    const template = new ACData.Template(templateJson);

    const data = {
      title: 'Task Confirmation',
      description: 'Are you sure you want to proceed?',
    };

    const card = template.expand({ $root: data });
    const cardAttachment = { contentType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive', content: card };
    ```

- **Adaptive Cards Samples:**
  - Refer to the [Adaptive Cards GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards) for sample cards and code snippets.
  - Explore the [Sample Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/samples/) to understand different card designs and implementations.

- **Dynamic Generation in Bot Logic:**
  - Based on user interactions, adjust the data passed into the card template to reflect the current context.
  - This allows the bot to respond with personalized or context-specific Adaptive Cards.

**Handling User Inputs from Adaptive Cards in Bot Logic:**

To handle user inputs from Adaptive Cards:

1. **Include Input Elements and Actions in the Card:**
   - Use input elements like `Input.Text`, `Input.ChoiceSet`, `Input.Toggle`, etc., to collect data.
   - Add an `Action.Submit` button to submit the user's input.
     ```json
     {
       "type": "Action.Submit",
       "title": "Submit",
       "data": {
         "action": "submitTask"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Process the Input in the Bot:**
   - When the user submits the card, their input is sent to the bot within the `Activity.Value` property.
   - In your bot's message handler, check for the presence of `Activity.Value` to determine if it's a response from an Adaptive Card.
   - Example in Node.js:
     ```javascript
     const { activity } = turnContext;

     if (activity.value && activity.value.action === 'submitTask') {
       const userInput = activity.value;
       // Handle the user input here
       await turnContext.sendActivity(`You submitted: ${JSON.stringify(userInput)}`);
     }
     ```
   - In C#:
     ```csharp
     if (turnContext.Activity.Value is JObject value && value["action"]?.ToString() == "submitTask")
     {
         // Access user input from the value object
         var userInput = value.ToObject<Dictionary<string, string>>();
         await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"You submitted: {JsonConvert.SerializeObject(userInput)}");
     }
     ```

3. **Maintain Conversation Flow:**
   - Optionally, use dialogs (like Waterfall Dialogs) to manage conversation state and handle complex interactions.
   - This allows you to guide the user through multi-step processes, utilizing both Adaptive Cards and traditional message prompts.

4. **Provide Feedback:**
   - After processing the input, send an Adaptive Card or message to confirm the action or provide the next steps.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const confirmationCard = {
       type: 'AdaptiveCard',
       body: [
         {
           type: 'TextBlock',
           text: 'Thank you! Your task has been submitted.',
           weight: 'Bolder'
         }
       ],
       $schema: 'http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json',
       version: '1.5',
     };

     await turnContext.sendActivity({ attachments: [{ contentType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive', content: confirmationCard }] });
     ```

**Additional Tips:**

- **Testing and Validation:**
  - Use tools like the [Adaptive Card Validator](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) to ensure your card JSON is correct.
  - Test your bot in Teams to confirm that the Adaptive Cards render and behave as expected.

- **Handling Events and Actions:**
  - For more advanced interactions, handle specific events like `imBack`, `messageBack`, or `invoke` to tailor the bot's response.
  - Ensure that your bot's Microsoft App ID and password are correctly configured to receive and process these events.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs received from Adaptive Cards.
  - Implement proper error handling to manage unexpected inputs or exceptions.

By implementing these practices, you can create interactive and user-friendly Adaptive Cards within your Teams bot, enhancing the overall user experience and engagement.

## Using Microsoft Graph API with Teams bots TypeScript

To integrate the Microsoft Graph API into a Teams bot for task management, you need to set up your bot to authenticate with Microsoft Graph, request the appropriate permissions, and make API calls to manage tasks in services like Planner, To Do, Calendar, and OneDrive. Below is a guide on how to achieve this:

**1. Integrating Microsoft Graph API into a Teams Bot for Task Management:**

- **Set Up Azure AD App Registration:**
  - Register your bot application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to obtain the necessary client ID and client secret.
  - Configure the authentication settings, including redirect URIs and required API permissions.

- **Choose Authentication Flow:**
  - **User-Delegated Permissions (OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow):**
    - This flow requires user interaction to grant permissions.
    - Suitable when actions need to be performed on behalf of the user.
  - **Application Permissions (Client Credentials Flow):**
    - Allows the bot to perform actions without user interaction.
    - Suitable for actions that are not user-specific.

- **Implement Authentication in Your Bot:**
  - Use an authentication library like **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)** or **Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)** to handle token acquisition.
  - For user-delegated permissions, implement an authentication dialog within the bot to prompt the user to sign in and consent to permissions.
  - For application permissions, securely store and use client credentials to acquire tokens.

- **Make Microsoft Graph API Calls:**
  - Use the acquired access token to call Microsoft Graph API endpoints related to task management.
  - Handle HTTP requests and responses appropriately, managing errors and exceptions.

**2. Required Permissions to Access Planner, To Do, Calendar, and OneDrive:**

For accessing different Microsoft 365 services, your application needs specific permissions:

- **Planner:**
  - `Tasks.Read`, `Tasks.ReadWrite` for user-delegated permissions.
  - `Group.Read.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All` for accessing group tasks.
  - For application permissions: `Tasks.Read.All`, `Tasks.ReadWrite.All`.

- **To Do:**
  - `Tasks.Read`, `Tasks.ReadWrite`.
  - Note that as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023-10, application permissions might not be supported for Microsoft To Do tasks.

- **Calendar:**
  - `Calendars.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite` for user calendars.
  - `Calendars.Read.Shared`, `Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared` for shared calendars.

- **OneDrive:**
  - `Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite` for user files.
  - `Files.Read.All`, `Files.ReadWrite.All` for all files accessible by the user.
  - `Sites.Read.All`, `Sites.ReadWrite.All` for accessing SharePoint sites and their files.

Make sure to request the least privileged permissions necessary for your bot's functionality to adhere to the principle of least privilege.

**3. Code Snippets for Creating, Updating, and Assigning Tasks:**

While specific code snippets may vary based on your development environment, the general approach is as follows:

- **Creating a Task in Planner:**

  ```javascript
  // Assume you have an authenticated Microsoft Graph client
  const plannerTask = {
    planId: '<plan-id>',
    bucketId: '<bucket-id>',
    title: 'New Task Title',
    assignments: {
      '<user-id>': {
        "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.plannerAssignment",
        "orderHint": " !"
      }
    }
  };

  await graphClient.api('/planner/tasks')
    .post(plannerTask);
  ```

- **Updating a Task in Planner:**

  ```javascript
  const updatedTask = {
    title: 'Updated Task Title'
  };

  await graphClient.api('/planner/tasks/<task-id>')
    .header("If-Match", etag) // etag is the task's ETag value
    .patch(updatedTask);
  ```

- **Assigning a Task to a User:**

  ```javascript
  const assignment = {
    assignments: {
      '<new-user-id>': {
        "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.plannerAssignment",
        "orderHint": " !"
      }
    }
  };

  await graphClient.api('/planner/tasks/<task-id>')
    .header("If-Match", etag)
    .patch(assignment);
  ```

- **Creating a To Do Task:**

  ```javascript
  const todoTask = {
    title: 'New To Do Task'
  };

  await graphClient.api('/me/todo/lists/<list-id>/tasks')
    .post(todoTask);
  ```

**4. Handling Authentication and Token Management within the Bot:**

- **Using Microsoft Teams Toolkit and TeamsFx SDK:**
  - The TeamsFx SDK simplifies authentication by handling OAuth 2.0 flows.
  - It provides methods to acquire access tokens and make authenticated Graph API calls.

- **Implementing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow:**

  - **User Signs In:**
    - The bot prompts the user to sign in via an authentication card or dialog.
    - Use the Bot Framework's OAuthPrompt or similar mechanism.

  - **Acquire Access Token:**
    - Once the user signs in, the bot receives an authorization code.
    - Exchange this code for an access token using MSAL.

  - **Token Caching and Refreshing:**
    - Store tokens securely and refresh them as needed.
    - Tokens should be stored in a way that associates them with the user but protects sensitive information.

- **Using On-Behalf-Of Flow for Bots:**

  - In scenarios where the bot needs to act on behalf of the user, use the On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow.
  - Acquire a token using the user's token provided in the bot's context.

  ```javascript
  const { ConfidentialClientApplication } = require('@azure/msal-node');

  const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
      clientId: '<your-client-id>',
      clientSecret: '<your-client-secret>',
      authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>'
    }
  };

  const cca = new ConfidentialClientApplication(msalConfig);

  const oboRequest = {
    oboAssertion: userToken, // Token from the user context
    scopes: ['https://graph.microsoft.com/.default']
  };

  const response = await cca.acquireTokenOnBehalfOf(oboRequest);
  const accessToken = response.accessToken;
  ```

- **Securely Managing Client Secrets:**

  - Store client secrets securely, such as in Azure Key Vault.
  - Do not hard-code secrets in your application code or configuration files.

- **Handling Permissions and Consent:**

  - Ensure that the permissions requested are consented to by the user or administrator.
  - For application permissions, an administrator must grant consent.

- **Error Handling and Token Expiration:**

  - Implement error handling for token acquisition failures.
  - Monitor token expiration and refresh tokens proactively.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Use Microsoft Graph SDKs:**
  - Utilize the Microsoft Graph SDK for your programming language to simplify API calls.
  - The SDK handles many aspects of HTTP communication and error handling.

- **Refer to Documentation and Samples:**

Utilizing custom intent recognizers, middleware, and the Teams AI Library enables bots to interpret user intents and provide meaningful responses without the need for traditional dialog systems. This approach simplifies bot development and leads to more natural and efficient conversational interactions with users.

## Sending notifications and proactive messages in Teams channels TypeScript

To send notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel when tasks are assigned or updated, you can use proactive messaging in a Teams bot. Proactive messaging allows your bot to initiate conversations and send messages without requiring a user to first send a message to the bot.

**Steps to Implement Proactive Messaging in a Teams Bot:**

1. **Obtain Necessary Identifiers:**
   - **Channel ID or Team ID:** You'll need the channel ID where you want to send the notification. This can be obtained when your app is installed in the team or channel.
   - **Tenant ID:** The tenant ID is required for authentication and can be retrieved from incoming activities or during the app installation process.
   - **Service URL:** This is the URL where your bot will send messages. It can be obtained from the incoming activity or by using global service URLs provided by Microsoft Teams.

2. **Create the Conversation (if necessary):**
   - Since proactive messages are sent without an active conversation context, you may need to create a conversation with the channel.
   - Use the `ConversationParameters` object to specify the channel or team where the message will be sent.
   - For example, in C#, you can use the `ConnectorClient.Conversations.CreateConversationAsync` method with the appropriate parameters.

3. **Get the Conversation Reference:**
   - The conversation reference contains all the information needed to continue a conversation with the channel.
   - You can store this reference when your bot is installed or when it first interacts with the channel.
   - Storing the conversation reference allows you to send messages to the channel at any time.

4. **Send the Proactive Message:**
   - Use the stored conversation reference to send a message to the channel.
   - In your bot code, use the `continueConversation` method (or `ContinueConversationAsync` in C#) to send the message within the appropriate context.
   - Construct the message activity, which can include text, attachments, or Adaptive Cards.

**Code Examples for Sending Messages:**

- **Sending Messages to Channels:**
  - **C#:**
    ```csharp
    var conversationParameters = new ConversationParameters
    {
        IsGroup = true,
        ChannelData = new TeamsChannelData
        {
            Channel = new ChannelInfo(channelId)
        },
        Activity = MessageFactory.Text("Your proactive message")
    };

    await connectorClient.Conversations.CreateConversationAsync(conversationParameters);
    ```
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
    ```javascript
    const conversationParameters = {
        isGroup: true,
        channelData: {
            channel: {
                id: channelId
            }
        },
        activity: MessageFactory.text("Your proactive message")
    };

    await connectorClient.conversations.createConversation(conversationParameters);
    ```

- **Sending Messages to Individual Users:**
  - **C#:**
    ```csharp
    var conversationParameters = new ConversationParameters
    {
        Members = new[] { new ChannelAccount(userId) },
        Activity = MessageFactory.Text("Your proactive message")
    };

    await connectorClient.Conversations.CreateConversationAsync(conversationParameters);
    ```
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
    ```javascript
    const conversationParameters = {
        members: [{ id: userId }],
        activity: MessageFactory.text("Your proactive message")
    };

    await connectorClient.conversations.createConversation(conversationParameters);
    ```

**Ensuring the Bot Has Necessary Permissions:**

1. **Install the Bot in the Target Channel or Team:**
   - The bot must be installed in the team or channel where it needs to send messages.
   - Users can add the bot manually, or you can proactively install the bot using Microsoft Graph APIs.
   - Without the bot being installed, it cannot send messages to that channel or team.

2. **Configure App Permissions:**
   - In Azure, configure the app registration for the bot to have the necessary permissions.
   - For channel messaging, ensure that the `ChannelMessage.Send` permission is granted.
   - Update the app manifest to include the correct scopes (`team`, `groupChat`, `personal`) based on where the bot will operate.

3. **Trust the Service URL:**
   - Before creating the `ConnectorClient`, call `MicrosoftAppCredentials.TrustServiceUrl(serviceUrl)` to trust the service URL.
   - This is important to avoid authentication issues when sending messages.

4. **Handle Permission-Related Errors:**
   - Implement error handling in your bot code to catch and address permissions errors.
   - If you receive a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response, check that the bot is installed correctly and that permissions are properly configured.

5. **Authentication and Tokens:**
   - Ensure that your bot is properly authenticated and has a valid bearer token before making API calls.
   - Use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) for authentication.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Storing Conversation References:**
  - Consider storing conversation references when the bot is added to a channel or when it interacts with users.
  - This allows you to send messages later without needing to recreate the conversation.

- **Using Teams SDK Helpers:**
  - Utilize classes like `TeamsInfo` to get information about teams, channels, and users.
  - This can simplify obtaining necessary IDs and context.

- **Testing Proactive Messages:**
  - Note that proactive messaging may not work in the Bot Framework Emulator.
  - Use tools like ngrok to test proactive messages locally by tunneling external requests to your local bot.

By following these steps and ensuring proper permissions, your Teams bot will be able to send proactive notifications to channels when tasks are assigned or updated, enhancing your team's workflow and communication.

## Integrating OneDrive file uploads in Teams bots TypeScript

**How can users upload files through a Teams bot using OneDrive integration?**

Users can upload files through a Microsoft Teams bot integrated with OneDrive in two primary ways:

1. **File Consent Cards:** The bot sends a message to the user containing a `FileConsentCard` attachment. This card requests permission to upload a file on behalf of the user. When the user accepts the request, the bot receives an invoke activity with a location URL provided by OneDrive. The bot can then upload the file to this URL, and the user will receive a confirmation once the upload is complete.

2. **Direct File Attachments:** Users can send files directly to the bot by attaching them in the message compose area within Teams. When the user sends the message, the bot receives a message activity containing metadata about the file, including a content URL. The bot can use this URL to access and process the file uploaded to the user's OneDrive for Business storage.

**What are the methods for handling file attachments in a Teams bot?**

There are two methods for handling file attachments in a Teams bot:

1. **Using Microsoft Graph APIs:**
   - **Scope of Use:** Works in all Microsoft Teams scopes, including personal chats, group chats, and channels.
   - **Capabilities:** Allows the bot to interact with OneDrive and SharePoint to manage files, access user drives, and handle files in channels and group chats.
   - **Implementation:** Requires appropriate permissions set up in Azure and involves using Microsoft Graph endpoints to upload, download, and manage files.

2. **Using Teams Bot APIs:**
   - **Scope of Use:** Supports files in the personal context only (one-on-one chats with the bot).
   - **Capabilities:** Enables the bot to receive files sent directly by the user and to send files to the user by requesting consent through `FileConsentCard`.
   - **Implementation:** Uses Teams-specific endpoints and activities to handle file interactions within personal chats.

**Are there sample codes for uploading and attaching files to tasks via Microsoft Graph API?**

Yes, there are sample codes and documentation available for uploading and attaching files via the Microsoft Graph API. These samples demonstrate how to:

- **Obtain File Consent:** Use `FileConsentCard` to request permission from the user to upload a file.
- **Upload Files to Teams:** Upload files to the provided OneDrive URL after obtaining consent.
- **Handle File Attachments:** Process files sent by the user as attachments in messages.

These samples can be found in the official Microsoft documentation and repositories, such as the [Microsoft Teams Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples), which include examples in various programming languages like Python and Node.js. They provide step-by-step guidance and code snippets to implement file upload and handling functionalities in a Teams bot using Microsoft Graph API.

**How do you manage file permissions and access when integrating OneDrive with a bot?**

Managing file permissions and access when integrating OneDrive with a Teams bot involves several key steps:

1. **Azure App Registration:**
   - **Register the Bot:** In the Azure portal, register your bot as an application to obtain the necessary credentials for authentication.
   - **Create a Client Secret:** Generate a client secret (app password) which the bot will use in the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.

2. **Set Up Permissions:**
   - **API Permissions:** Configure the required Microsoft Graph API permissions for your bot application. This typically includes delegated permissions such as `User.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`, and others depending on the functionalities you need.
   - **Admin Consent:** If necessary, ensure that an administrator grants consent for these permissions so that all users in the organization can use the bot without individual consent prompts.

3. **Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow:**
   - **Authenticate Users:** Use the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate users when they interact with the bot. This may involve redirecting users to sign in and consent to the permissions requested by the bot.
   - **Access Tokens:** Obtain access tokens on behalf of the user, which the bot can use to call Microsoft Graph API endpoints to interact with OneDrive files.

4. **Handle File Operations Securely:**
   - **Use the Provided URLs:** Always use the secure URLs provided by OneDrive and Teams for uploading and accessing files.
   - **Validate Permissions:** Ensure that the bot only accesses files that it has permissions for, and respect the user's permissions and consent.
   - **Store Tokens Safely:** Securely handle and store any tokens or credentials obtained during the authentication process to prevent unauthorized access.

By carefully setting up the Azure app registration, configuring the appropriate permissions, and correctly implementing the OAuth 2.0 flow, you can manage file permissions and access effectively. This ensures that your Teams bot can interact with OneDrive files securely and in compliance with organizational policies and user consent.

## Generating analytics and reports in Teams bots TypeScript

To calculate the number of completed and pending tasks in a Teams bot, and to generate project progress reports, you can implement the following strategies:

### **Calculating Completed and Pending Tasks**

1. **Implement a Database for Task Management**:
   - **Store Task Data**: Use a database to store tasks with attributes such as task ID, description, assigned user, and status (`completed`, `pending`).
   - **Update Task Status**: Whenever a task is updated through the bot (e.g., marked as completed), update the task's status in the database.
   - **Count Tasks**: Query the database to count tasks based on their status.
     - Example for completed tasks:
       ```sql
       SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE status = 'completed';
       ```
     - Example for pending tasks:
       ```sql
       SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE status = 'pending';
       ```

### **Generating Project Progress Reports within the Bot**

1. **Use Adaptive Cards for Reporting**:
   - **Create Adaptive Cards**: Design Adaptive Cards to display task summaries directly within Teams conversations.

By integrating these strategies into your Teams bot, you can effectively manage tasks, provide users with detailed progress reports, and enhance the bot's interactivity with visual analytics. Efficient data storage and retrieval will ensure that your bot remains responsive and scalable as the number of users and tasks grows.

## Error handling and user feedback in Teams bots TypeScript

**Best Practices for Implementing Error Handling in Teams Bots**

Implementing robust error handling in Teams bots is essential to ensure a seamless user experience and to maintain the reliability of your bot. Here are some best practices:

1. **Customize the Global Error Handler (`onTurnError`)**:
   - The Bot Framework allows you to define a global error handler using the `adapter.onTurnError` property.
   - By customizing this handler, you can define how your bot should respond to errors during interactions.
   - This enables you to manage exceptions gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to users when things go wrong.

2. **Handle Specific Errors in Command Handlers**:
   - Utilize command handlers like `TeamsFxBotCommandHandler` provided by the TeamsFx SDK.
   - Within these handlers, you can catch exceptions specific to commands and respond accordingly.
   - This approach allows for fine-grained error handling and improves the bot's resilience.

3. **Check for Valid Installation Context and Credentials**:
   - Ensure that the bot is correctly installed in Teams and that it operates within the expected context.
   - Validate the bot's credentials (ID and password) to prevent authentication errors, such as "Failed to decrypt conversation ID".
   - Implement checks for the correct installation of the bot, especially when using APIs that might fail if the bot isn't installed properly (e.g., `findChannel()` API).

4. **Use Shared Storage for Persisting Data**:
   - In production environments, use your own shared storage solution to persist important data.
   - This practice helps prevent losing notification target connections or other critical information after a bot restart or redeployment.
   - Persistent storage also aids in maintaining state and handling errors related to data persistence.

5. **Design for Graceful Failure**:
   - Anticipate unexpected events and design your bot to handle them without crashing.
   - The Bot Framework SDK automatically responds with a 200 – OK to events not explicitly handled, preventing unhandled exceptions.
   - Override methods in your bot to implement custom logic for Teams-specific activities, ensuring comprehensive error handling.

**Displaying Friendly Error Messages to Users When an Action Fails**

## Setting reminders and scheduling in Teams bots TypeScript

A Teams bot can set reminders for users or teams by leveraging proactive messaging and integrating scheduling functionalities provided by Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Graph APIs.

**Setting Reminders with a Teams Bot:**

To set reminders, your bot can use **proactive messaging**, which allows it to initiate conversations or send messages at scheduled times without requiring immediate user interaction. Here's how you can implement this:

1. **Capture Conversation References:** When a user interacts with the bot, capture the `conversationId` and `serviceUrl`. These are needed to send messages to the user or team proactively.

2. **Create an API Endpoint:** Develop an API endpoint within your bot's code that can send a proactive message when called. This endpoint will use the captured conversation references to direct messages appropriately.

3. **Schedule Messages:** Use a scheduler like **Azure Functions with a Timer Trigger** to call your API endpoint at specified times. Azure Functions can execute code based on a schedule, effectively allowing you to send reminders at the right moment.

**Integrating the Calendar API from Microsoft Graph for Scheduling:**

To integrate scheduling functionalities, you can use the **Microsoft Graph Calendar API**. This enables your bot to interact with users' calendars for creating events and reminders:

1. **Register Your Application:** Register your bot application in Azure Active Directory to obtain the necessary permissions to access Microsoft Graph APIs.

2. **Authenticate and Authorize:** Implement authentication flows to securely access Microsoft Graph on behalf of the user. This typically involves using OAuth 2.0 protocols to obtain access tokens.

3. **Use Calendar APIs:** Utilize endpoints provided by Microsoft Graph to create, read, update, or delete calendar events. This can help in scheduling reminders based on calendar events or in setting up new events that act as reminders.

**Code Examples for Confirming Reminder Setups:**

There are code samples available that demonstrate how to confirm reminder setups to users:

- **Message Reminder Setup via Messaging Extension:** This sample illustrates how a user can schedule a task through a messaging extension and receive a confirmation card at the scheduled time. It involves a user-friendly interface for scheduling and confirmation.

- **Bot Daily Task Reminder:** This example shows how a bot can send recurring reminders to users. It includes code for scheduling tasks, handling user inputs, and sending confirmation messages.

These samples are part of the Microsoft Teams Samples repository and provide practical examples of how to implement reminder functionalities in your bot.

**Handling Time Zones and Localization:**

Time zones and localization are crucial for ensuring reminders are received at the correct local time:

1. **User's Time Zone:** Obtain the user's time zone preference. This can be done by accessing the user's profile information or by asking the user to specify their time zone when setting up a reminder.

2. **Time Conversion:** When scheduling reminders, convert the time to a standard time zone like UTC for consistency in storage and processing. Before sending the reminder, convert the time back to the user's local time zone.

3. **Use Localization Libraries:** Utilize localization libraries or APIs that handle date and time formatting based on locale settings. This ensures that dates and times are presented in a format familiar to the user.

4. **Testing:** Rigorously test your bot across different time zones to ensure accuracy in scheduling and delivering reminders.

By carefully managing time zones and localization, you ensure that reminders are both accurate and meaningful, enhancing the user's experience with the bot.

**Summary:**

- **Proactive Messaging:** Essential for sending scheduled reminders without immediate user interaction.

## State management in Teams bots without dialogs TypeScript

Managing user and conversation state in a Microsoft Teams bot without using the dialog system involves directly utilizing the Bot Framework's state management features. Here's how you can achieve this, along with information on storage options, examples of using middleware, and how state management interacts with AI intent recognition and action planning.

### **1. Managing User and Conversation State Without the Dialog System**

**State Management Objects:**
- **UserState and ConversationState:** These are objects provided by the Bot Framework SDK that allow you to store and manage state data specific to a user or a conversation. They function independently of the dialog system.

**State Property Accessors:**
- **Creating Accessors:** You can create state property accessors to read from and write to the state properties. These accessors act as keys to store and retrieve values from the state management objects.
  ```csharp
  // Example in C#
  var userStateAccessor = userState.CreateProperty<UserProfile>("UserProfile");
  var conversationStateAccessor = conversationState.CreateProperty<ConversationData>("ConversationData");
  ```

**Saving State Changes:**
- **Persisting Data:** After making changes to the state, you need to save these changes so they persist across turns. This is done by calling the `SaveChangesAsync` method on the state management objects at the end of each turn.
  ```csharp
  await userState.SaveChangesAsync(turnContext);
  await conversationState.SaveChangesAsync(turnContext);
  ```

**Implementing Without Dialogs:**
- **Direct Handling:** You can handle the logic within the bot's turn handler methods (e.g., `OnMessageActivityAsync`) by accessing and updating the state as needed without invoking any dialogs.

---

### **2. Storage Options for Maintaining State Across Interactions**

**In-Memory Storage:**
- **Usage:** Suitable for testing and development purposes. It doesn't persist data once the application stops.

**Azure Blob Storage:**
- **Features:** Ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data, including state information for bots.

**Azure Cosmos DB Partitioned Storage:**
- **Benefits:** Provides globally distributed, scalable, and highly responsive storage. It's suitable for bots with a large number of users.

**Azure Table Storage:**
- **Characteristics:** A NoSQL key-value storage solution that's cost-effective and straightforward for state management needs.

**SQL Databases:**
- **Applicability:** Traditional relational databases can be used if your application already relies on SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.

**Redis Storage:**
- **Advantages:** An in-memory data store that offers fast read and write operations. Using modules like RedisJSON allows for efficient handling of JSON data, which is commonly used in bot state.

**Custom Storage Solutions:**
- **Flexibility:** You can implement custom storage adapters by inheriting from the Bot Framework's storage interface and defining custom read, write, and delete operations to suit your specific needs.

---

### **3. Examples of Using Middleware for State Management**

**Custom Middleware Implementation:**
- **Purpose:** Middleware in the Bot Framework can intercept and process messages between the adapter and the bot logic.

**State Management via Middleware:**
- **Process:** While the Bot Framework doesn't provide out-of-the-box middleware specifically for state management without dialogs, you can create custom middleware to manage state. This can involve:
  - **Interception:** Capturing and modifying incoming and outgoing activities.
  - **State Operations:** Reading from and writing to state before the bot logic processes the message or before the response is sent to the user.

**Example Scenario:**
- **Audit Logging Middleware:** Logs user messages and bot responses along with state information.
- **Translation Middleware:** Adjusts messages based on user preferences stored in the user state.

**Implementing Middleware:**
- **Steps:**
  1. **Create a Middleware Class:** Inherit from `IMiddleware` and implement the `OnTurnAsync` method.
  2. **Inject State Management:** Access the state management objects within the middleware.
  3. **Register Middleware:** Add the middleware to your bot adapter's middleware collection.

---

### **4. Interaction Between State Management and AI Intent Recognition and Action Planning**

**Enhanced Contextual Understanding:**
- **Maintaining Context:** By preserving user and conversation state, the bot can understand the context of the conversation, which improves intent recognition accuracy.

**Personalized Interactions:**
- **User Profiles:** Storing user preferences, past interactions, or profile information enables the bot to personalize responses and actions.

**Sequential Flow Management:**
- **Tracking Progress:** State management allows the bot to keep track of conversation progress without dialogs, ensuring that multi-turn interactions are coherent.

**Improved Decision-Making:**
- **Action Planning:** With access to historical data from the state, the bot can make better decisions on which actions to take next, leading to more effective and natural conversations.

**Example Implementation:**
- **Intent Handling:**
  - **State Access:** When an intent is recognized, the bot accesses the state to determine prior interactions.
  - **Dynamic Responses:** Adjusts responses based on stored information (e.g., if a user has already received certain information).

**Integrating AI Services:**
- **LUIS or QnA Maker Integration:** State data can be used alongside AI services to enhance the bot's understanding and responses.

---

**In Summary**, managing user and conversation state without the dialog system involves directly using the Bot Framework's state management capabilities. By choosing appropriate storage options and possibly implementing middleware, you can effectively maintain state across interactions. This state management is crucial for improving AI intent recognition and action planning, leading to more natural and effective conversations in your Teams bot.

## Utility functions and core bot logic organization TypeScript

The recommended project structure for a Teams bot using the Bot Framework and Teams AI Library involves modularizing your codebase by separating different concerns into distinct directories or modules. Organizing your bot in this way enhances maintainability and readability, making it easier to manage and scale as the project grows.

**Organization of Utility Functions and Core Bot Logic:**

- **Utility Functions:**
  - Place utility functions in separate modules or files dedicated to reusable code.
  - Export utility functions directly at the top level of their module as independent exports rather than wrapping them in classes or exporting them as static methods. This approach avoids unnecessary complexity and facilitates easier imports.
  - Avoid wrapping stateless utility functions in classes, as this can hinder optimization techniques like tree-shaking, which improves performance by eliminating unused code during the build process.
  - When importing utility functions, use the correct syntax depending on how they're exported:
    - For named exports:
      ```typescript
      import { functionName } from './utils';
      ```
    - For default exports:
      ```typescript
      import functionName from './utils';
      ```

- **Core Bot Logic:**
  - Keep the main bot logic in a central location, such as an `app.js` or `bot.js` file, depending on your project's entry point.
  - Separate different functionalities within your bot logic into modules or services if they become extensive, which aids in maintainability and testing.

**Templates and Sample Projects Illustrating Best Practices:**

- Numerous templates and sample projects are available in official documentation and community repositories that showcase best practices for structuring Teams bots with the Bot Framework and Teams AI Library.
- These resources provide guidance on effectively organizing code, implementing modularization, and following industry standards.
- Exploring these examples can offer insights into project layout, coding conventions, and design patterns that enhance the functionality and maintainability of your bot.

**Modularizing Code for Prompts, Card Templates, and Action Handlers:**

- **Prompts:**
  - Create a dedicated directory or module for prompts to handle user interactions. Each prompt can be a separate file if they are complex, or grouped together if they are simple.
  - Export prompt functions or classes from these modules for use in your main bot logic.

- **Card Templates:**
  - Organize card templates in their own directory, with each template in a separate file. This separation allows for easy management and updates to individual templates without affecting others.
  - Use descriptive filenames for each card template to quickly identify their purpose.

- **Action Handlers:**
  - Place action handlers in a dedicated directory, grouping related actions together where appropriate.
  - Export handler functions that process specific user actions or events within the bot.
  - This modularization makes it straightforward to add, remove, or modify actions as the bot's capabilities evolve.

By structuring your project with clear separation of concerns, you promote code reusability and simplify maintenance. Each module can be developed and tested independently, which streamlines the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors when making changes.

This organizational strategy not only enhances the current development experience but also makes it easier for new developers to understand the project structure when joining the team, facilitating collaboration and knowledge transfer.

## Environment configuration for Teams bots TypeScript

To securely manage environment variables like `BOT_ID`, `BOT_PASSWORD`, `OPENAI_KEY`, and others, it's essential to use environment files and configuration libraries that keep sensitive information out of your source code and version control. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Securely Managing Environment Variables

1. **Use a `.env` File for Local Development:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
   - Store your sensitive environment variables in this file, each on a new line:

     ```env
     BOT_ID=your_bot_id
     BOT_PASSWORD=your_bot_password
     OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

   - The `.env` file is a simple way to manage environment-specific configurations without hardcoding values.

2. **Exclude the `.env` File from Version Control:**

   - Add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to your version control system:

     ```gitignore
     # .gitignore
     .env
     ```

   - This ensures that sensitive information doesn't get exposed in public repositories.

3. **Use Environment Variables for Different Environments:**

   - For production environments, set environment variables directly on the server or through your deployment platform's configuration settings (e.g., Azure App Service settings, AWS environment variables).
   - Avoid using a `.env` file in production unless it's securely managed and not accessible publicly.

### Using the `dotenv` Library for Configuration

The `dotenv` library loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, making them accessible within your application.

1. **Install the `dotenv` Library:**

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

2. **Configure `dotenv` in Your Application:**

   - At the beginning of your application's entry point (e.g., `index.js` or `app.js`), require and configure `dotenv`:

     ```javascript
     require('dotenv').config();
     ```

   - This will parse the `.env` file and add the variables to `process.env`.

3. **Access Environment Variables in Your Code:**

   ```javascript
   const botId = process.env.BOT_ID;
   const botPassword = process.env.BOT_PASSWORD;
   const openAiKey = process.env.OPENAI_KEY;
   ```

4. **Handling Multiple Environment Files (Optional):**

   - You can create environment-specific files like `.env.development`, `.env.production`, etc.
   - Load a specific file based on the environment:

     ```javascript
     const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
     require('dotenv').config({ path: `.env.${env}` });
     ```

### Setting Up the `restify` Server for Local and Production Environments

When configuring your `restify` server, you should account for differences between development and production environments.

1. **Configure Server Settings Using Environment Variables:**

   ```javascript
   const restify = require('restify');
   const server = restify.createServer();

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3978; // Default port for local development

   server.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`${server.name} listening to ${server.url}`);
   });
   ```

2. **Differentiate Environments:**

   - Use the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to check the environment:

     ```javascript
     const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
     ```

   - Apply environment-specific configurations:

     ```javascript
     if (isProduction) {
       // Production-specific settings
     } else {
       // Development-specific settings
     }
     ```

3. **Secure Production Configurations:**

   - Ensure that production environment variables are set securely on the server.
   - Avoid exposing any sensitive information or server details in logs or error messages.

### Handling Configuration Differences Between Development and Deployment

Managing different configurations for development and production environments is crucial for application stability and security.

1. **Use Environment Variables for Configurations:**

   - Rely on environment variables to configure services, database connections, API keys, etc.
   - This allows your application to adapt based on where it's running without code changes.

2. **Maintain Separate Configuration Files (If Necessary):**

   - In addition to using environment variables, you might maintain separate configuration files for different environments.
   - Use a configuration management library or a custom solution to load the correct settings.

3. **Example of Conditional Configuration:**

   ```javascript
   let storage;

   if (isProduction) {
     // Use persistent storage in production
     storage = new AzureTableStorage({
       accountName: process.env.AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME,
       accountKey: process.env.AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY,
       tableName: process.env.AZURE_TABLE_NAME,
     });
   } else {
     // Use in-memory storage for development
     storage = new MemoryStorage();
   }
   ```

4. **Automate Environment Setup:**

   - Use scripts or tools to set up environment variables when deploying.
   - For example, in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions, you can set environment variables in the pipeline.

5. **Securely Manage Secrets in Production:**

   - Use secret management tools provided by your hosting environment, such as Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or environment variable settings in Heroku.
   - These services provide an additional layer of security for sensitive information.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Secrets Out of Code and Repositories:**

  - Never hardcode secrets or push them to version control systems.
  - Regularly audit your codebase to ensure compliance.

- **Use Environment Variables for Configuration:**

  - Environment variables provide a flexible and secure method to configure applications.
  - They are universally supported across hosting environments.

- **Implement Configuration Management:**

  - Use configuration libraries or patterns that support multiple environments.
  - Ensure consistency across development, staging, and production.

- **Secure Your Development Environment:**

  - Even in development, treat your `.env` file carefully.
  - Be cautious when sharing code or collaborating to avoid exposing secrets.

- **Monitor and Rotate Secrets Regularly:**

  - Regularly update and rotate API keys and passwords.
  - Use tools to detect leaked secrets and respond promptly.

By following these practices, you can securely manage your environment variables, properly utilize the `dotenv` library for configuration, set up your `restify` server appropriately for different environments, and handle configuration differences effectively between development and deployment. This approach enhances the security of your application and ensures a smooth development and deployment process.

const onTurnErrorHandler = async (context: TurnContext, error: Error) => {
    console.error(`\n [onTurnError] unhandled error: ${error}`);
    await context.sendTraceActivity(
        'OnTurnError Trace',
        `${error}`,
        'https://www.botframework.com/schemas/error',
        'TurnError'
    );
    await context.sendActivity('The bot encountered an error or bug.');
};
```

2. AI Components Setup:
```typescript
const model = new OpenAIModel({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
    defaultModel: 'gpt-4',
    azureApiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY!,
    azureDefaultDeployment: 'gpt-4',
    azureEndpoint: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT!,
    logRequests: true
});

const prompts = new PromptManager({
    promptsFolder: path.join(__dirname, '../src/prompts')
});

const planner = new ActionPlanner({
    model,
    prompts,
    defaultPrompt: 'default'
});
```

3. Application Setup:
```typescript
const storage = new MemoryStorage();
const app = new ApplicationBuilder<ApplicationTurnState>()
    .withStorage(storage)
    .withAuthentication(adapter, {
        settings: {
            graph: {
                scopes: ['User.Read'],
                msalConfig: {
                    auth: {
                        clientId: process.env.AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID!,
                        clientSecret: process.env.AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET!,
                        authority: `${process.env.AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_HOST}/${process.env.AAD_APP_TENANT_ID}`
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    })
    .build();
```

4. Action Handlers:
```typescript
app.ai.action('createTask', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: TaskData) => {
    // Handle task creation
    return true;
});

app.ai.action(AI.FlaggedInputActionName, async (context, state, data) => {
    await context.sendActivity(`I'm sorry your message was flagged: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
    return AI.StopCommandName;
});
```

5. Server Setup:
```typescript
const server = restify.createServer();
server.use(restify.plugins.bodyParser());

server.post('/api/messages', async (req, res) => {
    await adapter.process(req, res as any, async (context) => {
        await app.run(context);
    });
});

server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, () => {
    console.log(`\n${server.name} listening to ${server.url}`);
});
```

6. Response Formatting:
```typescript
const responseFormatter = async (activity: Partial<Activity>) => {
    if (typeof activity.text === 'string') {
        // Convert markdown code blocks to HTML
        activity.text = activity.text.replace(
            /```(\w+)?\n(.*?)\n```/gs,
            '<pre><code>$2</code></pre>'
        );
    }
    return activity;
};
```

7. Adaptive Card Creation:
```typescript
export function createTaskCard(task: TaskData): Attachment {
    return CardFactory.adaptiveCard({
        type: 'AdaptiveCard',
        version: '1.5',
        body: [
            {
                type: 'TextBlock',
                text: task.title,
                size: 'Large',
                weight: 'Bolder'
            },
            {
                type: 'FactSet',
                facts: [
                    { title: 'Due Date:', value: task.dueDate },
                    { title: 'Assigned To:', value: task.assignedTo }
                ]
            }
        ],
        actions: [
            {
                type: 'Action.Submit',
                title: 'Update Status',
                data: {
                    taskId: task.id,
                    action: 'updateStatus'
                }
            }
        ]
    });
}
```

These code snippets provide a foundation for implementing the core infrastructure of the Project Assistant Bot. You can adapt and extend these patterns based on your specific requirements for task management, team collaboration, and other features.

## index.ts insperation

Here are relevant code snippets from the samples that can serve as inspiration for implementing the Project Assistant Bot:

1. Basic Setup and Imports:
```typescript
import { config } from 'dotenv';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as restify from 'restify';
import {
    ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory,
    MemoryStorage,
    TurnContext
} from 'botbuilder';
import {
    Application,
    ActionPlanner,
    OpenAIModel,
    PromptManager,
    TeamsAdapter
} from '@microsoft/teams-ai';
```

2. Teams Adapter Configuration:
```typescript
const adapter = new TeamsAdapter({},
    new ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory({
        MicrosoftAppId: process.env.BOT_ID,
        MicrosoftAppPassword: process.env.BOT_PASSWORD,
        MicrosoftAppType: 'MultiTenant'
    })
);
```

3. Error Handling Middleware:
```typescript
const onTurnErrorHandler = async (context: TurnContext, error: Error) => {
    console.error(`\n [onTurnError] unhandled error: ${error.toString()}`);
    await context.sendTraceActivity(
        'OnTurnError Trace',
        `${error.toString()}`,
        'https://www.botframework.com/schemas/error',
        'TurnError'
    );
    await context.sendActivity('The bot encountered an error or bug.');
};
```

4. AI Components Setup:
```typescript
const model = new OpenAIModel({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
    defaultModel: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    azureApiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY!,
    azureEndpoint: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT!,
    logRequests: true
});

const prompts = new PromptManager({
    promptsFolder: path.join(__dirname, '../src/prompts')
});

const planner = new ActionPlanner({
    model,
    prompts,
    defaultPrompt: 'default'
});
```

5. Application Builder with Authentication:
```typescript
const storage = new MemoryStorage();
const app = new ApplicationBuilder<ApplicationTurnState>()
    .withStorage(storage)
    .withAuthentication(adapter, {
        settings: {
            graph: {
                scopes: ['User.Read'],
                connectionName: process.env.OAUTH_CONNECTION_NAME ?? '',
                title: 'Sign in',
                text: 'Please sign in to use the bot.',
                endOnInvalidMessage: true
            }
        }
    })
    .build();
```

6. Server Setup and Message Handling:
```typescript
const server = restify.createServer();
server.use(restify.plugins.bodyParser());

server.post('/api/messages', async (req, res) => {
    await adapter.process(req, res as any, async (context) => {
        await app.run(context);
    });
});

server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, () => {
    console.log(`\n${server.name} listening to ${server.url}`);
});
```

7. Action Handler Pattern:
```typescript
app.ai.action('ActionName', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
    // Handle specific action
    await context.sendActivity('Action completed');
    return 'Action response';
});
```

These code snippets provide a foundation for implementing the core functionality of the Project Assistant Bot while following Teams AI SDK best practices.
