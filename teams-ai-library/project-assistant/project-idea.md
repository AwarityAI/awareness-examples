I would create a new sample for the Teams AI library called "Project Assistant Bot." This bot would integrate with the Microsoft Graph API to manage tasks, projects, and team collaboration directly within Microsoft Teams. By leveraging AI capabilities, the bot would understand natural language commands and facilitate project management activities seamlessly.

**Key Features:**

1. **Task Management Integration:**
   - **Microsoft Planner Integration:** Allow users to create, update, and track tasks in Microsoft Planner.
   - **To Do List Support:** Enable users to manage personal tasks using Microsoft To Do.
   - **Adaptive Cards:** Use rich Adaptive Cards to display task details and collect user input in an interactive way.

2. **Natural Language Understanding:**
   - **AI-Powered Intent Recognition:** Utilize AI models to interpret user commands like "Create a new task for the marketing campaign due next Friday" and map them to specific actions.
   - **Conversational Interaction:** Support multi-turn conversations to gather necessary details for task creation or updates.

3. **Action Mapping and Chaining:**
   - **Complex Workflow Handling:** Implement action chaining to handle sequences of actions, such as creating a task and then assigning it to a team member.
   - **Custom Actions:** Allow the bot to perform custom actions like setting reminders or updating task statuses based on user input.

4. **Team Collaboration:**
   - **Assignment Notifications:** Automatically notify team members when they are assigned a task.
   - **Status Updates:** Provide updates on task progress within the Teams channel.
   - **Meeting Scheduling:** Integrate with the Calendar API to schedule meetings related to specific tasks or projects.

5. **Authentication and Security:**
   - **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Implement Teams SSO to authenticate users securely without additional login prompts.
   - **Microsoft Graph API Permissions:** Use appropriate Graph API scopes to access user and team data while maintaining compliance with organizational policies.

6. **Advanced Features:**
   - **Proactive Messaging:** Send reminders or alerts for upcoming deadlines or important updates.
   - **Rich Media Support:** Incorporate images or files into tasks using OneDrive integration.
   - **Analytics and Reporting:** Provide summaries of project progress or task completion rates.

**Benefits of This Sample:**

- **Demonstrates Integration with Microsoft Graph API:** Shows how to interact with various Microsoft services like Planner, To Do, Calendar, and OneDrive.
- **Enhances Productivity:** Helps users manage their tasks and projects without leaving the Teams environment.
- **Showcases Advanced AI Capabilities:** Utilizes natural language processing to interpret user intents and facilitate complex actions.
- **Provides a Comprehensive Example:** Serves as a robust template for developers to build upon, illustrating best practices in bot development with the Teams AI library.

**Conclusion:**

The "Project Assistant Bot" sample would be a valuable addition to the Teams AI library, offering developers insights into building sophisticated, AI-powered bots that enhance collaboration and productivity within Microsoft Teams. By integrating with the Microsoft Graph API and showcasing advanced features like natural language understanding and action chaining, this sample would demonstrate the extensive capabilities of the Teams AI SDK.
