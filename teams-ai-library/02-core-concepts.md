## Actions

Actions in the Teams AI library are key components that define how your bot responds to user inputs and performs tasks. By leveraging the `Action` interface, developers can create, register, and handle both built-in and custom actions to provide rich and interactive experiences within Microsoft Teams.

### Defining and Handling Actions

An **action** represents a specific operation or response that the bot can perform in reaction to user inputs or AI-generated plans. Actions are defined using the `Action` interface by specifying properties that describe the action's characteristics and parameters.

#### The `Action` Interface

The `Action` interface typically includes the following properties:

- `name`: A unique identifier for the action, using alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dashes.
- `description`: An optional text that explains what the action does.
- `parameters`: An optional object that defines the expected input for the action, often structured as a JSON Schema to specify types and required fields.

By defining actions with the `Action` interface, you establish a contract that the AI system can utilize to understand what actions are available and how to invoke them.

#### Defining Actions

Actions can be defined directly in code or in an external `actions.json` file. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "LightsOn",
    "description": "Turns on the lights",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "intensity": { "type": "number" }
      },
      "required": ["intensity"]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Pause",
    "description": "Pauses the system"
  }
]
```

In this example, the `LightsOn` action expects an `intensity` parameter, whereas the `Pause` action does not require any parameters.

#### Registering Action Handlers

Once actions are defined, you need to register action handlers that dictate how the bot should respond when these actions are invoked. This involves associating each action with a specific handler function that implements the desired behavior.

##### Steps to Register Custom Action Handlers

1. **Define the Action**: Ensure that each action is uniquely named and properly defined with any required parameters.

2. **Create the Handler Function**: Write an asynchronous function that defines what the bot should do when the action is executed. The function typically accepts the context, state, and parameters.

   ```javascript
   async function handleLightsOnAction(context, state, parameters) {
     const intensity = parameters.intensity;
     // Logic to turn on the lights with the specified intensity
     await context.sendActivity(`Turning on the lights with intensity ${intensity}.`);
   }
   ```

3. **Register the Action Handler**: Use the bot application's AI capabilities to register the action and its handler.

   ```javascript
   app.ai.action('LightsOn', handleLightsOnAction);
   ```

4. **Handle Invocation**: When the action is invoked—either through user input or AI-generated plans—the framework executes the registered handler, allowing the bot to perform the specified operation.

By following these steps, you enable the bot to respond appropriately to actions and provide interactive functionalities within the conversation.

### Built-in Actions

The Teams AI library includes several built-in actions that offer fundamental functionalities, simplifying common tasks without the need for custom implementations.

#### `sayCommand`

- **Purpose**: Sends a message to the user.
- **Functionality**: Formats and delivers text messages appropriately for the Teams channel. It handles rich content and ensures messages are displayed correctly, managing any special content requirements.
- **Example Usage**:

  When the AI model generates a response that includes a `SAY` action, the `sayCommand` is executed to deliver that message to the user.

  ```json
  {
    "type": "SAY",
    "response": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
  }
  ```

#### `doCommand`

- **Purpose**: Executes a specified action or command.
- **Functionality**: Invokes other actions by name, optionally with parameters, allowing for dynamic execution of actions determined at runtime by the AI model.
- **Example Usage**:

  If the AI model decides to perform an action like turning on the lights, it might include a `DO` action in its response:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "DO",
    "action": "LightsOn",
    "parameters": { "intensity": 75 }
  }
  ```

  The `doCommand` interprets this instruction and calls the registered `LightsOn` handler with the provided parameters.

#### Other Built-in Actions

- **`unknown`**: Handles cases where the bot does not understand the user's input or cannot match it to an existing action.
- **`flaggedInput`**: Responds to user inputs that may contain inappropriate or flagged content.
- **`flaggedOutput`**: Ensures that any AI-generated outputs comply with content policies, preventing inappropriate responses.
- **`tooManySteps`**: Manages scenarios where the AI plans exceed a predefined number of steps, preventing excessive processing.
- **`httpError`**: Handles HTTP errors that may occur during the execution of actions or when communicating with external services.

These built-in actions streamline common bot operations and help maintain compliance with content policies and operational constraints.

### Custom Actions

While built-in actions provide essential functionalities, you may need to create custom actions tailored to your application's specific requirements. Custom actions allow your bot to handle unique scenarios and provide specialized interactions.

#### Creating Custom Actions

To create a custom action:

1. **Define the Action**: Specify a unique `name`, provide a `description`, and define any `parameters` the action requires.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "BookMeeting",
     "description": "Schedules a new meeting",
     "parameters": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "date": { "type": "string" },
         "time": { "type": "string" },
         "attendees": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
       },
       "required": ["date", "time"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Implement the Handler Function**: Write an asynchronous function that performs the desired operation.

   ```javascript
   async function handleBookMeetingAction(context, state, parameters) {
     const { date, time, attendees } = parameters;
     // Logic to schedule the meeting
     // ...
     await context.sendActivity(`Meeting scheduled on ${date} at ${time} with ${attendees.join(', ')}.`);
   }
   ```

3. **Register the Action Handler**: Register the action with your bot application.

   ```javascript
   app.ai.action('BookMeeting', handleBookMeetingAction);
   ```

By implementing custom actions, you enhance your bot's capabilities, providing a more tailored and engaging experience for users.

## Augmentations

Augmentations in the Teams AI library enhance the capabilities of AI models by adding additional functionalities and context to prompt templates. They improve the quality and relevance of generated responses, allowing AI models to process user inputs more effectively, execute complex tasks, and provide dynamic and responsive experiences to users.

## Memory and State Management

Memory and state management are crucial aspects of the Teams AI library, enabling bots to maintain context and continuity throughout user interactions. By effectively managing state, bots can provide coherent, contextually aware, and personalized experiences, enhancing overall user engagement within Microsoft Teams applications.

### Understanding `TurnState` and `MemoryFork`

#### `TurnState`

`TurnState` is a key component that holds information relevant to the current turn of the conversation. It acts as a container for all state information specific to the ongoing interaction, including:

- **Conversation State**: Data pertinent to the current conversation flow.
- **User State**: Information related to the individual user interacting with the bot.
- **Temporary State**: Any transient data needed for processing within the current turn.

By using `TurnState`, developers can access and manipulate data that persists across different stages of the conversation turn. This allows the bot to store and retrieve context, manage dialogues, and maintain stateful interactions without losing track of important information.

#### `MemoryFork`

`MemoryFork` is used to create a snapshot of the current state at a specific point in the conversation. It enables the bot to:

- **Branch Conversations**: Create divergent conversational paths while preserving the original context.
- **Simulate Changes**: Test outcomes by making temporary changes to the state without affecting the main conversation flow.
- **Handle Sub-Conversations**: Manage sub-dialogues independently, allowing for complex interaction patterns.

By utilizing `MemoryFork`, developers can manage complex interactions where the conversation may diverge based on user choices or actions, all while maintaining a consistent and coherent user experience.

### Managing Conversation and User State

Effective state management involves tracking both conversation state and user state throughout interactions. Here are strategies for managing state within the Teams AI library:

#### Conversation State

Conversation state refers to information relevant to the current conversation. This includes:

- **User Inputs**: The most recent messages or commands from the user.
- **Bot Responses**: The bot's replies or actions taken in response to user inputs.
- **Contextual Data**: Any established context that influences the conversation flow.

Use `TurnState` to store and retrieve this information. By keeping track of the conversation state, the bot can reference previous interactions, understand context, and provide more meaningful responses.

#### User State

User state encompasses information that is persistent across multiple conversations with the same user, such as:

- **User Preferences**: Settings or choices that the user has made.
- **Historical Data**: Past interactions or behaviors that inform current interactions.
- **Profile Information**: Details about the user that may influence the bot's behavior.

The Teams AI library provides mechanisms to store user state in a way that is accessible across different sessions and conversations. This persistence allows the bot to personalize interactions and remember important details about the user.

### Accessing and Modifying State Within Handlers

Within action handlers and other components of your bot, you can access and modify both conversation and user state. The `TurnContext` and state management properties provide methods to interact with state data.

#### Accessing State Properties

Use the state properties to access different levels of state:

- `state.conversation`: For conversation-specific data.
- `state.user`: For user-specific data.
- `state.temp`: For temporary data relevant only within the current turn.

#### State Methods

The following methods allow you to interact with the state:

- `state.getValue(path)`: Retrieve a value from the state using a specified path.
- `state.setValue(path, value)`: Set a value in the state at the specified path.
- `state.hasValue(path)`: Check if a value exists at the specified path.
- `state.deleteValue(path)`: Delete a value from the state at the specified path.

#### Example: Updating User Preferences

```javascript
async function updateUserPreference(context, state, parameters) {
  // Access user state
  let preferences = await state.user.getValue('preferences') || {};

  // Update preference based on parameters
  preferences[parameters.preferenceName] = parameters.preferenceValue;

  // Save updated preferences back to user state
  await state.user.setValue('preferences', preferences);

  await context.sendActivity(`Your preference for ${parameters.preferenceName} has been updated.`);
}
```

In this example, the handler accesses the user state to retrieve and update the user's preferences.

### State Management Best Practices

To ensure efficient and effective state management, consider the following best practices:

#### Keep State Minimal

- **Essential Data Only**: Store only information that is necessary for the conversation or user experience.
- **Reduce Complexity**: Keeping state minimal simplifies maintenance and reduces potential errors.

#### Use Clear Keys

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear and descriptive keys when storing data to make it easily understandable.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Apply consistent naming to avoid confusion and overlap.

#### Regularly Clean Up State

- **Expire Unneeded Data**: Implement mechanisms to clean up or expire state data that is no longer needed.
- **Improve Performance**: Regular cleanup helps maintain bot performance and responsiveness.

#### Secure State Data

- **Sensitive Information**: Avoid storing sensitive information unless necessary, and ensure it is properly secured.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations and organizational policies when handling user data.

### State Persistence Across Sessions

To persist state data across conversations and sessions, utilize storage mechanisms provided by the Teams AI library, such as `MemoryStorage`, or integrate with external storage solutions.

#### Using `MemoryStorage`

```javascript
const { MemoryStorage, ConversationState, UserState } = require('botbuilder');

const memoryStorage = new MemoryStorage();
const conversationState = new ConversationState(memoryStorage);
const userState = new UserState(memoryStorage);

const app = new Application({
  conversationState,
  userState,
  // ... other configurations
});
```

This setup enables your bot to store conversation and user state in memory, persisting data across turns. For production environments, consider using more robust storage solutions like Cosmos DB or Azure Blob Storage for scalability and reliability.

### Leveraging State for Contextual Awareness

By effectively managing memory and state, your bot can:

- **Maintain Context**: Understand and refer back to previous interactions.
- **Personalize Interactions**: Tailor responses based on user preferences and history.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide coherent and contextually aware interactions, increasing engagement and satisfaction.

By implementing these strategies and utilizing the state management features of the Teams AI library, developers can create bots that deliver rich, personalized, and effective conversational experiences within Microsoft Teams.

- **`AuthenticationManager`**: Manages the overall authentication flow, handling token retrieval, validation, and session management.
- **`OAuthBotAuthentication`**: Implements OAuth authentication for bots, managing the OAuth flow and token handling, including prompting users to sign in via OAuth cards.
- **`TeamsSsoBotAuthentication`**: Specifically designed for Teams SSO, this class manages the SSO authentication process using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to acquire tokens silently if the user is already authenticated.
- **Message Extension and Adaptive Card Authentication**: Additional mechanisms that enable authentication through message extensions and adaptive cards, providing flexibility in how users authenticate within the bot.

### Implementing Authentication in Your Bot

To implement authentication in your bot:

1. **Choose an Authentication Method**: Decide whether to use OAuth authentication, Teams SSO, or a combination of both based on your application's requirements.

2. **Configure Authentication Settings**: Set up the necessary configuration parameters, such as client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs, in your bot's configuration file.

3. **Integrate Authentication Classes**: Utilize the appropriate authentication classes (`OAuthBotAuthentication` or `TeamsSsoBotAuthentication`) in your bot's code to manage the authentication flow.

   ```javascript
   const { OAuthBotAuthentication } = require('teams-ai');

   const auth = new OAuthBotAuthentication({
     connectionName: 'YourConnectionName',
     clientId: 'YourClientId',
     clientSecret: 'YourClientSecret',
     redirectUri: 'YourRedirectUri'
   });

   app.ai.use(auth);
   ```

4. **Handle Token Management**: Implement logic to retrieve, store, and validate user tokens securely, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.

   ```javascript
   async function handleAuthenticatedRequest(context, state, parameters) {
     const token = await auth.getUserToken(context);
     if (token) {
       // Proceed with authenticated operations
     } else {
       await auth.signInUser(context);
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Test Authentication Flows**: Thoroughly test the authentication process to ensure that users can log in seamlessly and that their tokens are handled correctly.

By implementing robust authentication mechanisms, developers can ensure that their bots provide secure and personalized experiences for users within the Teams environment. Proper authentication not only protects sensitive data but also enhances user trust and engagement with the bot.

## Tokenization

Tokenization is a crucial process in natural language processing (NLP) and AI models that involves breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, phrases, or even characters, depending on the specific requirements of the AI model being used. In the context of the Teams AI library, tokenization plays a significant role in preparing input text for AI models, ensuring that the text is formatted correctly for processing and understanding. By converting raw text into a structured format, tokenization enables AI models to interpret input accurately and generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

### Importance of Tokenization in AI Models

- **Input Preparation**: Tokenization transforms raw text into a structured format that AI models can understand. This is essential for models that require input in a specific tokenized format to generate meaningful responses.

- **Model Efficiency**: By breaking down text into tokens, models can process information more efficiently. Focusing on smaller, manageable units allows for faster computations and improved performance.

- **Contextual Understanding**: Tokenization helps maintain the context of the text by preserving the relationships between tokens, which is vital for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.

- **Handling Variability**: It allows models to manage variations in language, such as synonyms, different grammatical structures, and colloquialisms, by representing them in a consistent token format.

- **Managing Input and Output Sizes**: Tokenization aids in controlling the sizes of input and output, ensuring they adhere to token limits imposed by AI models.

- **Overall Efficiency**: Enhances the efficiency of language processing in AI systems, contributing to better performance and user experiences.

### Using Tokenizers

The Teams AI library provides several tokenizer classes to facilitate the tokenization process:

- **`GPTTokenizer`**: Specifically designed for models based on the GPT architecture, this tokenizer efficiently converts input text into tokens that GPT models can process effectively. It ensures compatibility with the model's input requirements, optimizing performance.

- **`GPT3Tokenizer`**: Tailored for the GPT-3 model, this tokenizer provides optimized tokenization that aligns with the specific needs and capabilities of the GPT-3 architecture.

- **The `Tokenizer` Interface**: This interface defines the methods and properties that all tokenizer classes must implement, providing a consistent and interoperable approach to tokenization across different models within the library.

These tokenizers serve two primary functions:

- **Encoding Text**: Converting input text into numerical token IDs that the AI models can process. This involves breaking down the text into tokens according to the model's tokenization scheme.

- **Decoding Tokens**: Converting the model's output tokens back into human-readable text, enabling the interpretation of the generated responses.

By utilizing these tokenizers, developers can ensure that their input text is appropriately prepared for AI models, enhancing the models' ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. Proper tokenization is fundamental to the overall performance and effectiveness of AI systems in processing natural language.

### Functionalities of the `Tokenizer` Interface

The `Tokenizer` interface provides essential functionalities that enable AI models to process and generate text effectively. Key functionalities include:

- **Encoding**: The ability to convert input text into a sequence of tokens (numerical IDs), preparing the text in a format that the AI model can understand and process.

- **Decoding**: Converting sequences of tokens back into human-readable text, allowing for the interpretation of the model's output.

- **Token Length Calculation**: Determining the length of text in terms of tokens, which is important for managing input and output sizes and adhering to token limits.

- **Token Management**: Handling tokenization strategies, including managing the vocabulary and special tokens used in tokenization, ensuring alignment with the specific requirements of different AI models.

By handling the conversion between human language and tokens, the `Tokenizer` interface ensures effective communication between text and AI models, facilitating tasks such as text generation, translation, and comprehension.
