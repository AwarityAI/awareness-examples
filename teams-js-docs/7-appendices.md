### 7.1.1 Introduction to the Glossary

**Purpose of the Glossary**

The glossary provides definitions for key terms and abbreviations used throughout the documentation. It serves as a reference to help readers understand specific terminology related to our software and development processes.

**How to Use the Glossary**

- Terms are organized alphabetically.
- Use this section as a reference for clarifying terminology.
- Cross-references are provided where applicable.

### 7.1.2 Terms and Definitions

**A**

- **Activity**

  An Activity represents an event or communication exchanged between a user and a bot. It can be a message, notification, or any other type of interaction. Activities carry data back and forth and are fundamental to bot communication.

- **Adaptive Card**

  An Adaptive Card is a JSON-based UI framework for integrating interactive card content within applications. It allows developers to present rich card experiences, such as forms or media, that adapt to the host application's look and feel.

**B**

- **Bot Client**

  The Bot Client is the software component that handles communication between the user and the bot. It is responsible for sending and receiving activities, managing sessions, and ensuring smooth interaction.

**C**

- **Conversation Reference**

  A Conversation Reference is an object that contains information necessary to continue a conversation between a user and a bot. It includes details like the conversation ID, user ID, and channel ID, allowing the bot to send proactive messages or resume conversations.

## 7.2 Migration Guides

### 7.2.1 Overview of Migration

**Importance of Migration**

Upgrading to the latest version of our software is essential to leverage new features, performance improvements, and security enhancements. Regular updates ensure that your applications remain compatible with the evolving technological landscape and adhere to industry best practices.

- **Benefits of Updating**
  - **Access to New Features:** Stay ahead with the latest functionalities that can enhance your application's capabilities.
  - **Improved Performance:** Benefit from optimizations that make your application run more efficiently.
  - **Security Enhancements:** Protect your application with the latest security patches and updates.
  - **Better Compatibility:** Ensure seamless integration with other updated systems and services.

**General Migration Guidelines**

To facilitate a smooth transition to the latest version, consider the following best practices:

- **Plan Ahead:** Review the migration guides and understand the scope of changes.
- **Backup Your Application:** Always create a backup before starting the migration process.
- **Update Dependencies:** Ensure all dependent packages and libraries are compatible with the new version.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Implement comprehensive testing to identify and fix issues early.
- **Incremental Updates:** If possible, break down the migration into smaller, manageable steps.

### 7.2.2 Migrating from Previous Versions

**Breaking Changes**

When migrating, it's crucial to be aware of changes that may affect existing implementations:

- **Activity Types Renamed:** Some activity types have been renamed for consistency. For example, `MessageExtensionAction` might have updated properties that require code adjustments.
- **Modified Interfaces:** Interfaces like `Activity`, `ConversationReference`, and `Attachment` may have new required fields or altered structures.
- **Deprecated Methods:** Certain methods in the API might be deprecated. Relying on them could cause your application to fail.

**Deprecated Features**

Features no longer supported and their recommended alternatives:

- **Old Authentication Flows:** Legacy authentication methods have been deprecated. Transition to the new OAuth-based authentication for better security.
- **Unsupported Card Formats:** Some outdated card formats are no longer rendered correctly. Use Adaptive Cards for a richer UI experience.

**New Features and Enhancements**

Explore the new capabilities introduced in the latest version:

- **Enhanced Adaptive Cards:** Improved support for Adaptive Cards with new elements and actions.
- **Adaptive Card Invoke Actions:** Implement `AdaptiveCardInvokeAction` for more interactive card responses.
- **Expanded Messaging Extensions:** Utilize new messaging extension actions like `messageExtension/submitAction` for better user interactions.
- **Improved Authentication Model:** Leverage the updated OAuth model for secure token exchange and authentication flows.

**Step-by-Step Migration Process**

Follow these steps to update your codebase:

1. **Review Release Notes:** Start by reading the release notes to understand all changes.
2. **Update Libraries:** Upgrade your project to use the latest versions of all official libraries and SDKs.
3. **Refactor Code:**
   - Replace deprecated methods and classes with their updated counterparts.
   - Update activity types and interfaces according to the new definitions.
4. **Update Authentication Flow:**
   - Implement the new OAuth authentication mechanisms.
   - Replace old token exchange methods with `TokenExchangeInvokeRequest` and `TokenExchangeState`.
5. **Test Your Application:**
   - Perform unit tests to check individual components.
   - Conduct integration tests to ensure all parts work together.
6. **Deploy Gradually:** If possible, roll out the updated application to a small user group before full deployment.

### 7.2.3 Known Issues and Workarounds

**Common Migration Issues**

During migration, you might encounter the following issues:

- **Compilation Errors:** Due to changes in interfaces and types.
- **Authentication Failures:** Resulting from deprecated authentication flows.
- **Runtime Exceptions:** Caused by unexpected structure changes in activities or messages.

**Solutions and Workarounds**

- **Compilation Errors:**
  - **Solution:** Reference the updated interfaces in the new version. Adjust your code to accommodate changes in property names and types.
- **Authentication Failures:**
  - **Solution:** Transition to the new OAuth authentication flow. Use `TokenExchangeInvokeRequest` for token exchanges.
- **Runtime Exceptions:**
  - **Solution:** Validate all activity and message structures at runtime. Ensure that the data conforms to the expected formats.

If you continue to face issues, consider reaching out to the community support forums or consult the detailed API documentation for further guidance.
