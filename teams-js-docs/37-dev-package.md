## DevTools Plugin

The **DevTools Plugin** is an essential tool in the Dev Package that facilitates advanced debugging and inspection capabilities within your application. It allows developers to monitor application behavior in real-time, inspect activities, and interact with the application through a user-friendly interface.

### Setting Up the DevTools Plugin

To integrate the DevTools Plugin into your application, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Necessary Modules**: Import the `App` class from `@teams.sdk/apps` and the `DevtoolsPlugin` from `@teams.sdk/dev`.

    ```typescript
    import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
    import { DevtoolsPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/dev';
    ```

2. **Initialize Your App**: Create a new instance of the `App` class, providing your application credentials and including the `DevtoolsPlugin` in the `plugins` array.

    ```typescript
    const app = new App({
      clientId: 'your-client-id',
      clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
      tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
      plugins: [new DevtoolsPlugin({ port: 3001 })],
    });
    ```

3. **Start the App**: Call the `start` method on your app instance to start the application with the DevTools Plugin enabled.

    ```typescript
    // Start the App with the DevTools plugin
    app.start().then(() => {
      console.log('App is running with DevTools available at http://localhost:3001/devtools');
    });
    ```

### Features and Capabilities

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Observe the application's activities as they happen, providing insights into the application's behavior during development.

- **Interactive Interface**: Use the DevTools web interface to interact with your application, send test activities, and view responses.

- **Debugging Support**: Inspect the details of activities, including messages sent and received, to identify and resolve issues quickly.

- **Customizable Port**: Configure the DevTools Plugin to run on a specific port that suits your development environment.

### Code Sample: Using DevTools Plugin

```typescript
import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
import { DevtoolsPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/dev';

const app = new App({
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
  tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
  plugins: [new DevtoolsPlugin({ port: 3001 })],
});

// Start the App with the DevTools plugin
app.start().then(() => {
  console.log('App is running with DevTools available at http://localhost:3001/devtools');
});
```

## Console Plugin

The **Console Plugin** is a valuable tool within the Dev Package that allows developers to simulate user interactions directly from the command line. This plugin enables interactive development and testing without the need for a graphical user interface, making it ideal for quick testing and debugging.

### Leveraging the Console Plugin for Interactive Development

By integrating the Console Plugin into your application, you can:

- **Simulate User Interactions**: Test how your application responds to user inputs by typing messages directly into the console.
- **Rapid Development Cycle**: Quickly iterate on application logic and see immediate feedback without the overhead of deploying to a live environment.
- **Debugging**: Easily trace and debug responses in a controlled environment.

### Simulating User Interactions via the Console

To use the Console Plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Necessary Modules**: Import the `App` class and the `ConsolePlugin`.

    ```typescript
    import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
    import { ConsolePlugin } from '@teams.sdk/dev';
    ```

2. **Initialize Your App with the Console Plugin**: Create a new instance of the `App` class and include the `ConsolePlugin` in the `plugins` array.

    ```typescript
    const app = new App({
      clientId: 'your-client-id',
      clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
      tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
      plugins: [new ConsolePlugin()],
    });
    ```

3. **Start the App**: Start your application, and it will listen for input from the console.

    ```typescript
    // Start the App with the Console plugin
    app.start().then(() => {
      console.log('App is running in console mode. Type messages to interact with the bot.');
    });
    ```

### Code Sample: Interactive Console Testing

```typescript
import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
import { ConsolePlugin } from '@teams.sdk/dev';

const app = new App({
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
  tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
  plugins: [new ConsolePlugin()],
});

// Start the App with the Console plugin
app.start().then(() => {
  console.log('App is running in console mode. Type messages to interact with the bot.');
});
```

## Utilities

The Dev Package includes a variety of utility functions that simplify common development tasks, reducing the need for external dependencies and allowing for more efficient coding practices.

### Utilizing Additional Utilities to Streamline Development Tasks

The utilities provided can help in several ways:

- **Custom Logging**: Implement advanced logging mechanisms to monitor application behavior and debug issues efficiently.
- **Local Storage Management**: Use local storage utilities to manage data persistence within your application without the need for external storage solutions.
- **Simplified APIs**: Access simplified application programming interfaces (APIs) for common tasks, enabling quicker development cycles.

### Examples of Utility Functions Available in the Dev Package

Below are some examples of how to utilize the built-in utilities provided by the Dev Package.

#### Code Sample: Utility Functions

```typescript
import { Logger } from '@teams.sdk/common/logging';
import { LocalStorage } from '@teams.sdk/common/storage';

// Example: Setting up a custom logger
const logger: Logger = {
  info: (message: string) => console.log(`INFO: ${message}`),
  warn: (message: string) => console.warn(`WARN: ${message}`),
  error: (message: string) => console.error(`ERROR: ${message}`),
  child: (context: string) => ({
    info: (message: string) => console.log(`[${context}] INFO: ${message}`),
    warn: (message: string) => console.warn(`[${context}] WARN: ${message}`),
    error: (message: string) => console.error(`[${context}] ERROR: ${message}`),
    child: (childContext: string) => logger.child(`${context}/${childContext}`),
  }),
};

// Log messages
logger.info('Application started');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('An error occurred');

// Example: Using LocalStorage for data persistence
const storage = new LocalStorage<{ [key: string]: string }>({}, { max: 10, ttl: 60000 });

// Add data to storage
storage.set('key1', 'value1');
console.log('Stored value:', storage.get('key1'));

// Update data in storage
storage.set('key1', 'updatedValue1');
console.log('Updated value:', storage.get('key1'));

// Delete data from storage
storage.delete('key1');
console.log('Deleted value:', storage.get('key1'));
```

In this example:

- **Custom Logger**: The code demonstrates how to set up a custom logger using the `Logger` interface from `@teams.sdk/common/logging`. This logger can be tailored to the specific needs of your application and provides methods for logging informational messages, warnings, and errors.

- **Local Storage**: The `LocalStorage` class from `@teams.sdk/common/storage` is used to manage data persistence locally. The example shows how to create a storage instance with specified options, add data, update it, and delete it.

These utilities help developers manage key aspects of their applications more efficiently, allowing for better performance and easier maintenance.
