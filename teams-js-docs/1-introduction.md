// Ensure you have the following prerequisites:
// 1. Node.js version 14 or higher
// 2. A valid Microsoft Azure AD App Registration with the following:
//    - Client ID
//    - Client Secret
//    - Tenant ID

// Setting up environment variables
process.env.CLIENT_ID = 'your-client-id';
process.env.CLIENT_SECRET = 'your-client-secret';
process.env.TENANT_ID = 'your-tenant-id';
```

### Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Install the Teams SDK package**:

   ```bash
   npm install @teams.sdk
   ```

2. **Import the required modules**:

   ```typescript
   import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
   import { HttpPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/apps/plugins/http';
   ```

3. **Initialize the app with your Azure AD credentials**:

   ```typescript
   const app = new App({
     clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
     clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
     tenantId: process.env.TENANT_ID,
     plugins: [new HttpPlugin()],
   });
   ```

4. **Start the app and verify it's running**:

   ```typescript
   app.start().then(() => {
     console.log('App is running...');
   });
   ```

### Quick Start Guide

#### Creating a Basic Teams Application

Follow these steps to create a basic Microsoft Teams application using the Teams SDK for JavaScript:

1. **Set up a new Teams application project**:

   Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-teams-app
   cd my-teams-app
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Install necessary modules and plugins**:

   ```bash
   npm install @teams.sdk @teams.sdk/apps @teams.sdk/apps/plugins/http
   ```

4. **Import necessary modules and plugins in your code**:

   Create an `index.js` or `app.js` file and include the following:

   ```typescript
   import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
   import { HttpPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/apps/plugins/http';
   ```

5. **Initialize the app with configuration options**:

   ```typescript
   const app = new App({
     clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
     clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
     tenantId: process.env.TENANT_ID,
     plugins: [new HttpPlugin()],
   });
   ```

6. **Define middleware to handle incoming activities**:

   ```typescript
   app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
     // Handle incoming activities
     await next();
   });
   ```

7. **Start the application**:

   ```typescript
   app.start().then(() => {
     console.log('Teams application is running...');
   });
   ```

**Example Code: Basic Teams Application**

```typescript
import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
import { HttpPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/apps/plugins/http';

const app = new App({
  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
  tenantId: process.env.TENANT_ID,
  plugins: [new HttpPlugin()],
});

app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  // Your middleware logic here
  await next();
});

app.start().then(() => {
  console.log('Teams application is running...');
});
```

[Placeholder for diagrams illustrating the application architecture]

#### Understanding the Code

- **App Initialization and Configuration**:

  The `App` class is initialized with your Azure AD credentials and any necessary plugins. The `HttpPlugin` enables your app to handle HTTP requests.

- **Middleware Functions and Activity Handling**:

  The `app.use()` function defines middleware that processes incoming activities. The `ctx` (context) object contains information about the activity, and `next()` passes control to the next middleware function.

- **Application Startup Process**:

  The `app.start()` method starts the application server and listens for incoming requests.

#### Creating a Simple Bot

In this section, you'll create a simple bot that echoes back any messages it receives.

1. **Import necessary modules**:

   ```typescript
   import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
   import { HttpPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/apps/plugins/http';
   ```

2. **Initialize the app with credentials and plugins**:

   ```typescript
   const app = new App({
     clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
     clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
     tenantId: process.env.TENANT_ID,
     plugins: [new HttpPlugin()],
   });
   ```

3. **Define middleware to handle incoming messages and send responses**:

   ```typescript
   app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
     if (ctx.activity.type === 'message') {
       await ctx.reply({
         type: 'message',
         text: `You said: ${ctx.activity.text}`,
       });
     }
     await next();
   });
   ```

4. **Start the bot application**:

   ```typescript
   app.start().then(() => {
     console.log('Bot is running...');
   });
   ```

**Example Code: Creating a Simple Echo Bot**

```typescript
import { App } from '@teams.sdk/apps';
import { HttpPlugin } from '@teams.sdk/apps/plugins/http';

const app = new App({
  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
  tenantId: process.env.TENANT_ID,
  plugins: [new HttpPlugin()],
});

app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  if (ctx.activity.type === 'message') {
    await ctx.reply({
      type: 'message',
      text: `You said: ${ctx.activity.text}`,
    });
  }
  await next();
});

app.start().then(() => {
  console.log('Bot is running...');
});
```

#### Explanation of Bot Functionality

- **Processing User Messages**:

  The bot checks if the incoming activity is a message. If it is, it responds by echoing back the message text.

- **Sending Replies Back to the User**:

  The `ctx.reply()` method sends a message back to the user, utilizing the Teams SDK's messaging capabilities.

- **Using Middleware for Activity Handling**:

  Middleware functions in the app allow you to process and respond to activities in a structured way.

  The sample project typically includes:

  - `src/`: Contains the source code files.
  - `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
  - `README.md`: Provides instructions and documentation.

- **Understanding the Code Organization**:

  - **Entry Point**: The main application file (`app.js` or `index.js`) initializes the app and starts the server.
  - **Middleware**: Functions that process incoming activities and messages.
  - **Plugins**: Extend the application's capabilities by adding features like HTTP handling.
