### Handling Advanced Conversation Scenarios

Advanced conversational scenarios require maintaining context and handling dynamic interactions. The `OpenAIChatModel` facilitates this through message history and function calling.

#### Techniques for Leveraging OpenAI Models in Complex Conversational Flows

By maintaining a history of messages, the model can understand the context of the conversation. You can provide previous messages using the `messages` parameter:

```typescript
import { LocalMemory } from '@teams.sdk/ai';

// Create a memory instance to store conversation history
const conversationHistory = new LocalMemory();

async function chatWithHistory(userInput: string) {
  // Add the user's message to the history
  await conversationHistory.push({
    role: 'user',
    content: userInput,
  });

  // Generate a response using the model with conversation history
  const response = await chatModel.chat({
    input: {
      role: 'user',
      content: userInput,
    },
    messages: conversationHistory,
  });

  // Add the model's response to the history
  await conversationHistory.push(response);

  console.log('AI Response:', response.content);
}

// Example usage
chatWithHistory('Tell me about the solar system.');
chatWithHistory('What is the largest planet?');
```

#### Managing Context and State with OpenAI's Chat Models

The `OpenAIChatModel` supports function calling, allowing the model to request additional data or perform actions during a conversation. You can define functions that the model can invoke:

```typescript
// Define a function that the model can call
const functions = {
  getWeather: {
    name: 'getWeather',
    description: 'Get the current weather for a location.',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        location: {
          type: 'string',
          description: 'The location to get the weather for.',
        },
      },
      required: ['location'],
    },
    handler: async (args: { location: string }) => {
      // Implement the logic to get weather data
      return {
        temperature: '22Â°C',
        condition: 'Sunny',
      };
    },
  },
};

// Use the chat model with function calling
async function chatWithFunctions(userInput: string) {
  const response = await chatModel.chat({
    input: {
      role: 'user',
      content: userInput,
    },
    functions,
  });

  console.log('AI Response:', response.content);
}

// Example usage
chatWithFunctions('What is the weather in New York?');
```

In this example, the model can decide to call the `getWeather` function to fetch real-time weather data, enhancing the conversation with dynamic content.

## Configuration and Usage

### API Key Management

To utilize the OpenAI Package, you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Proper management and security of your API keys are crucial to protect your account and ensure secure access to OpenAI services.

#### Steps for Obtaining and Securely Storing OpenAI API Keys

1. **Sign Up or Log In to OpenAI**: Visit the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Navigate to API Keys**: After logging in, go to the API keys section in your account dashboard.

3. **Generate a New API Key**: Click on "Create new secret key" to generate a new API key. Copy this key immediately as it will not be displayed again for security reasons.

4. **Securely Store the API Key**:
   - **Environment Variables**: Store the API key in an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) instead of hardcoding it in your application code.
   - **Configuration Files**: If you use configuration files, ensure they are excluded from version control systems like Git by adding them to `.gitignore`.
   - **Secret Management Services**: Consider using secret management services like Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Vault by HashiCorp for enhanced security.

```typescript
// Example of loading the API key from an environment variable
const chatModel = new OpenAIChatModel({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

#### Managing API Keys for Different Environments

When deploying your application across development, testing, and production environments, it's important to manage API keys appropriately:

- **Separate API Keys**: Use different API keys for each environment to prevent cross-environment access and to isolate any potential issues.
- **Configuration Management**: Employ environment-specific configuration files or variables to switch API keys based on the deployment environment.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to production API keys to authorized personnel only, and monitor usage to detect any unauthorized access.

### Configuring OpenAI Models

Fine-tuning the configuration of OpenAI models allows you to tailor the AI's behavior to suit your application's specific needs.

#### Setting Model Parameters Like `model`, `temperature`, and `timeout`

- **`model`**: Choose the appropriate model based on the required capabilities and performance considerations. Common options include `'gpt-4'`, `'gpt-3.5-turbo'`, and `'whisper-1'` for audio processing.
- **`temperature`**: Adjust the randomness of the AI's responses. Lower values produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values result in more creative and varied responses.
- **`timeout`**: Set a maximum duration for API requests to prevent hanging calls and improve the responsiveness of your application.

```typescript
const chatModel = new OpenAIChatModel({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  temperature: 0.5, // Balanced between creativity and determinism
  timeout: 10000,   // 10 seconds timeout
});
```

#### Customizing Base URLs and Other Advanced Configurations

In some cases, you might need to customize the base URL or add custom headers, especially if you're using a proxy or have specific compliance requirements.

```typescript
const chatModel = new OpenAIChatModel({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: 'https://api.openai.com/v1', // Custom API endpoint
  headers: {
    'Custom-Header': 'value',
  },
  organization: 'your-organization-id',
});
```

- **`baseUrl`**: Modify the API endpoint if necessary.
- **`headers`**: Add any custom headers required by your organization or proxy.
- **`organization`**: Specify your OpenAI organization ID if you are part of multiple organizations.
